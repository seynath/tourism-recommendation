The view, the food and the excellent service... and the rooftop bar.
And the infinity pool.
OK so this hotel has a lot going for it.

We'd booked in advance and paid a little extra for a (what we interpreted as) better room. We were a little disappointed to discover our family room was on the sub-level. Once we spoke to the reception they understood and installed us into a top floor room with amazing views over Kandy.
The food is great here. Chef will come out and say hello during dinner service. Breakfast is also excellent and swift.
Make sure you get a chance to enjoy the pool. Being on the edge of the world and looking into the busy green city is not to be missed. The pool is small and cute and only a few loungers so you need to be friendly with your fellow guests.
Also make sure to enjoy the evening sunset views from the rooftop bar. The music is good, the barmen are good, the vibe is good. It's just a good time!

Highly recommend this hotel for families and saw many couples enjoying it too.

Make sure you tip the bellboy. He's a good dude.

The rooms have international plugs, AC, minibar, hairdryers etc... the bathrooms have toiletries and everything you need.
Definitely get a tuktuk or taxi as its up a big hill.

Despite our initial positive impression from their rooftop bar, our stay was marred by a series of disappointments.

We booked a deluxe room with a balcony, but upon arrival, we were informed that the room didn’t have the balcony. The hotel promised us a double upgrade for the final night, but this turned out to be an empty promise. The room we were eventually given was smaller and less appealing than our original room, with a tiny balcony that hardly met our expectations.

The issues didn’t stop there. The voucher we received for the rooftop bar was misleading. We were told we would get a free drink and a 10% discount, but when we tried to use it, the staff claimed that only the 10% discount was valid and refused to honor the free drink. The food and drinks we had were subpar, with poor quality and slow service. We were also not provided an itemized receipt for our bill, which led to confusion and frustration when we were charged inconsistently with what was promised.

The staff, particularly the head concierge Nikitha, were unhelpful and condescending. We were made to feel like an inconvenience rather than valued guests. After numerous attempts to resolve the issues, including an unacceptable bill and rude service, we were eventually offered a partial discount as compensation.

In summary, our stay was plagued with poor service, unfulfilled promises, and a lack of professionalism. I would not recommend the Grand Serendip Hotel based on our experience.",Horrific,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r968933460-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We interacted with the Operations Manager, down to the Porter and Housekeeping staff. They were all friendly and very helpful. We had breakfast and dinner at the Restaurant. There was a wide selection of dishes at the buffet and they were all tasty. Each evening there was a singer to entertain. The two two children in our party loved dancing to the music. One evening we had a friend visiting for dinner. That day was actually her birthday. This was mentioned to one of the restaurant staff and we were surprised to receive a birthday cake and all the staff plus the singer joined in to sign Happy Birthday. A few hours after we checked-out from the hotel, received a call to say that the Housekeeping staff had found a rosary in our room. It was my wife's. They agreed to courier it to a relative of ours.

This is BY FAR, the best hotel I’ve stayed at during my trip. Here are my reasons.
1. For the price, you get far more than you pay for. 
2. The hotel is impeccably maintained. The rooms, the restaurants, all are spotless. 
3. The view is outstanding. As I sit here at breakfast sipping my coffee, I am in awe at the beauty of the city of Kandy. 
4. The view gets better as you head to the top floor which is called the Sky Lounge. There is a bar and restaurant serving fantastic drinks along with a variety of hookah offerings. 
5. The restaurant had a wonderful breakfast buffet and the a la cart menu for dinner was fantastic as well. 
6. The rooms. I walked in and immediately felt as I have arrived to luxury.  The bed was the softest I’ve slept in during my time in Sri Lanka. This served for the best night sleep I’ve had in weeks. The sliding glass door lead to the balcony which had a great view. 
7. The pool. This was an infinity pool overlooking the city. What more can you ask for. 
8. Location. I wanted something outside the city with a nice view but also in a quiet area as noise had bothered me at other hotels. The room was perfectly silent. Exactly what I needed before my long trip home. 
9. And last but not least, the hospitality. Lumbini was so sweet. Everyone you encounter is super kind with a smile on their face. Going above and beyond for every request you make. 
I will 100% return next time I’m in Kandy.",Best hotel I’ve stayed at in Sri Lanka!,2024-06,SOLO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r954749767-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.	Good Points
a.	This hotel is situated well 5-10Min walk to few restaurants, down the road, across the bridge.
b.	The room and toilet were clean.
c.	The staffs were friendly and very accommodating to our requests.
d.	The hotel has a bar near the restaurant. The cocktails served was good. This was my personal favorite.
e.	The buffet breakfast had decent amount of food variety, mostly Indian food of course, and it was all tasty.

2.	Bad Points
a.	I paid USD250 Per Night (including taxes) for the Luxury King room. Sadly, the room came with limited view of the Mountain/town. 
b.	The hotel does have a nice swimming pool, but it’s always crowded 
c.     The pillow and bed was just OK, nothing great

Positives: getting here at sunset, and stunning views, lovely welcome drink. Great gym and even has a squash court. Gorgeous pool area, bit cold though as in mountains.

Negatives: got the rooms at the back of hotel overlooking road (no privacy really), and rooms smallish and bathrooms very small!  Smelly as well (think it was the toilet water, smelt like a sewer).  Nice decor and clean enough, although only an overhead rainfall type shower and no shower caps, so had to recycle one from earlier. Shower over the bath and very slippery, not safe.

Not located close to Kandy (20 minutes up a windy road), so no options for food except hotel unless you wanted to arrange a tuk tuk, which was annoying. Food in hotel wasn't cheap as they have a captive audience due to location.  Got excited as there is a nightclub on premises, but it's only open on weekends. The other bar was closed for a conference or something, so no atmosphere to speak of.  We ended up drinking with a few others on the large verandah.  Apparently they wanted to charge $20USD for corkage for the others to drink their own wine outside (even though we weren't in the bar or restaurant),

This hotel has great potential, but is sadly let down by a few things. Beautiful lobby.

Having reached it after a long day, I instantly fell in love with it. The building was a beautiful, immaculate white with the façade reminding me of colonial buildings.

Upon entering, I was greeted by the front desk on my left, a garden in front of me, and a restaurant on my right. The front desk staff made me sit comfortably in the reception area while they smoothly carried out my check in formalities.

I was then taken to my room for which I had to cross the shopping arcade and the swimming pool. The shopping arcade looked quite glitzy and had a gemstone shop from where I was almost tempted to buy a few gems/ gem – encrusted jewellery.

The swimming pool, located on the ground floor, looked ethereal, illuminated by soft lanterns placed all around it. Dip into it! It was surrounded by the garden, the Uyana Restaurant, the Tamarind Bar, the deck area and a set of rooms, making it the central feature of the hotel.

I had booked myself a Deluxe Room that overlooked the River Mahaweli Ganga, a fact I realised the next morning! A lovely bookmark, with a quote from Buddha and a Nasturtium flower tucked into it, welcomed me into my room.

The room was of an adequate size, comfortably furnished, with all amenities available, as can be expected from a good hotel. The room was quite comfortable from a sleep POV; I got two good nights of sleep here.

The bathroom turned out to be quite a different one. The bathing area was at an elevation, and one had to climb a few steps, open a glass door and step inside for a shower.
I have to admit that it was not a great design from a safety viewpoint.

Most of my meals were at the Uyana Restaurant. Indulging in its dinner buffet was one of the top highlights during my stay. You should not miss the breakfast buffet either.
The restaurant offers a delightful array of freshly – baked pastries, a variety of fruits, and a selection of hot and cold dishes to kickstart your day.

I had a drink at the Tamarind Bar too. Sprawled on an armchair, I sipped on a Mango Martini made expertly by the smiling bartender. Enjoy your cocktails while partying with friends.

And that brings me to the staff attitude. I absolutely LOVED the staff at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel. All of them were always attentive, ever efficient and tremendously cordial. Every single one of them!
I was made to feel like a cherished guest and also made comfortable as I was a solo woman traveller.

I did not use many services at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel as I was mostly out and about sightseeing, but I did avail myself of the boat cruise offering.

To summarise, Mahaweli Reach Hotel in Kandy is indeed a good hotel, known for its exceptional service and luxurious amenities. It stands out as a premier establishment.

The breathtaking view of River Mahaweli Ganga creates a stunning backdrop as you unwind and socialise in this vibrant setting. As Mahaweli Reach Hotel is located a little away from the attractions of Kandy, it serves as an ideal resting place.",Book a stay with them!,2024-06,SOLO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d316941-r968071800-Mahaweli_Reach_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the breakfast met Rodney Armstrong the Resident Manager about the experience. Was surprised by his indifference and casual approach when I narrated the harrowing experience.

Although we arrived a bit late, the reception staff were initially reluctant to let us join. However, Ms. Nadeesah, the  stewardess , kindly encouraged us to enjoy the buffet and assured us that she would bring some food items to our table to save time. . She fulfilled her promise, allowing us to finish our meal in just 40 minutes. If we had followed the initial advice from the reception, we might not have had the opportunity to  have th breakfast  at your hotel and would have left looking for another hotel in Kandy. 
Ms. Nadeesah's exceptional business acumen was instrumental in our decision to stay back for the buffet. Your esteemed hotel, like many others in Sri Lanka, would greatly benefit from more staff members like  Nadeesha the stewardess , who use their common sense to attract guests. We also observed her assisting other foreign guests who arrived late, ensuring they could enjoy the morning buffet as well.

As Sri Lanka strives to promote tourism and boost foreign revenue, it is essential to encourage and support dedicated individuals like Ms. Nadeesah. We wish her all a all the luck !!
We aslos wish to  mention  that the food was quite good and the Hopper makers were helpful. However  as we had overstayted for 5 minutes one steward  informed us that time is up signalling us to leave.  I wish that this gentleman could have used a much more polite tone !!

We stayed 2 nights and both breakfasts were great. Nadeesha served us on day 2. She was very friendly and lovely. Only negative was that she interrupted our breakfast and wanted me to post a review and include her name.

He makes sure to talk to every guest, both foreigners and locals  personally to make sure everything is perfect during their stay and makes us feel very welcomed.

To start, the issue of room cleanliness was entirely unacceptable. Despite staying for two days, our room was not cleaned on the second day, and we had to wait until 4 PM after repeated requests to have it cleaned. To add insult to injury, we were informed that we should have put up a ""clean my room"" board—something that was never provided, nor were any instructions given regarding the process. This basic failure demonstrates a blatant disregard for guest comfort and standard service expectations. Furthermore, the toilets were smelly, and even the water had a foul odor, which added to the overall unpleasantness.
The dining experience was equally disappointing. Even though we placed our meal order an hour in advance, we still had to endure an additional 30-minute wait once seated. The quality of the food was shockingly subpar, with many items tasting stale as though they were reheated leftovers from previous days. It was incredibly frustrating that your staff displayed such dishonesty—when we requested specific items like chocolate ice cream, they failed to inform us of its unavailability beforehand, only to serve us a completely different item, such as vanilla, without any prior notice. This type of deceitful behavior is unacceptable and undermines the trust a guest should have in your establishment.
Moreover, even the simplest of requests, such as for ketchup or chocolate sauce, took an inordinate amount of time—sometimes up to 30 minutes—to fulfill. These are basic condiments that should be readily available, and the delay points to severe disorganization and lack of proper staff training.
The pool area also raised serious safety concerns. There were no visible depth measurements or safety instructions, which are basic standards for any swimming facility. The absence of clear safety signage is a liability risk and reflects poorly on your commitment to guest safety.
The most frustrating aspect was the consistent absence of your staff when they were needed the most. On multiple occasions, if one waiter was attending to a request, the rest of the team would vanish into the kitchen, leaving the service area entirely unattended. This lack of attentiveness and unprofessional conduct not only led to inconvenience but also created a sense of insecurity, as there was no one available for assistance in potentially urgent situations, the female who was in the reception was busy was on the phone and was not paying attention to the Customer. 
Overall, this stay was characterized by consistent incompetence, from unclean rooms and smelly toilets to stale food, slow service, poor communication, and a lack of safety measures. It was abundantly clear that guest satisfaction was not a priority at your establishment.

The shower worked well as the water was sufficiently hot.  I closed the door from the bedroom to the bathroom as the latter's small window wouldn't shut.  This minimised the risk of mosquitoes pestering a sleeping guest.

One single bed in the room seemed in relatively poor condition but the other one was far better, so I chose the latter and slept well. Linen was of reasonable quality.

The aircon was excellent in my room but some others in our group complained.  One couple apparently experienced a 'low' of 26 degrees: a staff member attended and promised to fix it but was not again seen.

In our group stay of two nights, the buffet on the first night was outside, while on the second night, it was indoors.  There did not seem to be many mosquitoes.  Food was fine, and service also pleasing.

The pool was pleasant, and not over chlorinated.  The attendant was quick to supply a pool towel.

WiFi worked well.

Reception staff were helpful.

Overall though, the rooms need an upgrade.  The room experience was similar to an Australian or USA 2.5 to barely 3 star motel.

When we wanted to relax in the touted tranquility and air conditioning of our US$230 (plus tax) room, instead the room pounded with the base of the dance party happening literally on the other side the wall. We complained to the hotel and received the response, “But the music ends by 4:00 PM.” Apparently, the hotel’s “safe haven” status only applies in the evenings. When our driver intervened, the hotel offered to move our room, but it wouldn’t make a difference. The rooms, elevator, garden, and entire property (including the drivers’ rooms in the building across the parking lot) pulsed like a nightclub. 

Lake Forest can be a pricey luxury hotel for reconnecting with nature, or it can be a booming dance hall for loud and large Sri Lankan weddings. It cannot be both.

We stayed in a spacious sea view cabana that was perfectly equipped for all weather conditions, whether rain (umbrellas) or shine (bug spray). The cabana offered a great balance of luxury and comfort, with more than enough space to relax and enjoy the serene surroundings.

The service was impeccable throughout our stay. Special mention to Dinesh, who went above and beyond to organize a beautiful birthday meal right on the beach—an experience we’ll never forget. Our butler, Dulanjana, was outstanding. He was professional, attentive, and made sure we had no worries during our stay. His care and attention to detail truly enhanced our experience.

The food at Jetwing Surf was incredible. Every meal was a visual and culinary delight, thanks to the talented chef. The quality and presentation were always of the highest standard. Even during our early morning safari, the hotel ensured that we had a packed breakfast and drinks ready for our 5 AM departure, which was a thoughtful touch.

Our safari at Kumana National Park was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of our trip. This was all recommended and arranged by the resort.  We were lucky enough to see leopards, elephants, deer, and so many other animals up close in their natural habitat. The wildlife was abundant, and the best part was how peaceful it felt—at times, it seemed like we had the entire park to ourselves!

The experience was well-organized and truly immersive. The beauty of Kumana lies not just in the animals but also in the quiet, untouched wilderness. It’s a must-do for anyone visiting the area, and we highly recommend it!

We also indulged in in-room massages, which were fantastic—perfect for unwinding. The pool was clean and a great spot to relax during the day.

This resort truly goes above and beyond, treating guests like royalty. We are already recommending it to our friends and family and cannot wait to return ourselves.

The food was excellent and your staff were very accommodating and allowed us to make changes without making a fuss.

The cabana was spacious and inviting. The bed was very comfortable and linen was soft and cozy!

The pool was very inviting and the water was clean and the temperature was perfect and the pool boy Ajith was very friendly.

Certian suggestions : 
1. The road from Jetwing Surf to Kottukal Beach house , about 100 mtrs stretch length, is not metalled - it is broken . Walking is difficult on the road. Better it is repaired and maintained by both the resorts.
2. There is paucity of light on the road from Jetwing Surf to Kottukal Beach House.  Both the resorts can look into this aspect and arrange proper lights.
3. Jetwing surf can maintain a e-rickshaw ( tuktuk) service within their resort and also between the two resorts so that commuting between the two places is not troblesome.

Jetwing Surf Pottuvil, Sri Lanka - a place for R & R.
Review of Jetwing Surf
Reviewed 13 Nov 2022

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * *

I would like to start by referring to my earlier review posted to Trip Advisor dated 13th November 2022 re the visit to Jetwing Surf, Pottuvil Point, Sri Lanka.

This second visit was on Sunday 4th February 2024 when eleven of us booked into 6 Cabanas in great trepidation as the others had at the last minute read my 13th November 2022 review.  Some of the servers recognized us & assured us that we will be happy this time & we were.

All Cabanas had glass panels placed right up to the architecturally beautiful Conic Rooves, blocking out any insects & creepy crawlies which made our previous stay miserable.   They only had fans inside the Cabanas then.  Now they have installed air conditioners too.  

It would have cost them quite a bit.  However, I hope guests will read this review of mine & visit the place hopefully not just for a day or two.  Why not make it a beautiful vacation during the season and I assure you, no one will regret it.

The No. 12 Cabana my husband & I occupied had an extremely comfortable King-size bed with pillows so perfect, only the alarm would wake us from sleep.  All other amenities from a mini bar, coffee/tea service to hair dryer, little toiletries, bathrobes, beach slippers, umbrellas etc. etc. were there for our use.  The shower toilet area is unique with a style of its own.

Though there is no Television set in the Resort, we had free Wi-Fi service.

There was a hiccup in our No.12 Cabana which was not the case with the ones occupied by our friends.  The Toilet had a suction issue which the management tried hard to correct not quite successfully & in fact, offered a change of Cabana too which we did not take up.  

The service all round was excellent.  Led by Pavan (butler/server/other roles), the staff worked at tandem & the Chef de cuisine made sure we had the desired à la carte meals presented in decorative style.  On this occasion, all meals were flavoursome & the quantity just right.   Way to go Chef Gemunu Chameera & Team!

The Swimming pool & the surrounding area in the resort is beautiful.  Once more, I hope the management will make the (romantic) lighting on the ground better as we had to use our cellphone lights to walk the area leading to the dining hall. 

Our trip this time was not during the season.  One should go to the East Coast during the dry season which is from May to September when the beaches are pristine, the sea of Sri Lanka is calmer & water sports are possible.

As a final note, my husband & I were absolutely thrilled with the Management as they had in a matter of 15 months, attended to my & maybe other guests’ previous comments about shortfalls.   

Kudos & blessings to the Jetwing Surf Resident Manager Mr. Azeem Hafi, & his dedicated, pleasant Team.

Relatively small with about 20 or so cabanas / huts but each is very generously sized and can easily accommodate 4 people. Staff were great and very attentive with our own ‘personal butler’. As the hotel is relatively small the menu is a la carte with a western and Srilankan option. East part of Sri Lanka is still  underdeveloped compared to the south west with smaller surfer hotels along the coast. Have to be willing to be more adventurous if you want to go out of the hotel.

Where you can't stop taking photos! 

We stayed for 10 nights which we was longer than most, probably people visit for a few days which probably would be best. 

We took a long taxi to get here fome colombo! Took us 8 hours. Arranged by the resort which was very helpful and efficient. 

The cabanas - we took a risk with no air con as the fans and sea breeze we thought would be sufficient, unfortunately it was sweltering hot.  We had a lower cabana which doesn't have ceiling fans but has the standing fans...it was so so hot that sleep was difficult.. this heat is nothing the resort can do about of course and I understand and agree with the owner that air con isn't good for the planet ..so I totally get it. But its important to note how hot we felt in case this will be an issue for you..it was for us and did affect our enjoyment.  I ended up with a heat rash half way through the holiday!:( 

This said Anna was SO accommodating and moved us to an upper cabana when they were free, she did this without charge and we definitely felt cooler in an upper cabana as they have ceiling fans and higher ceilings.. so I'd recommend if going when hot to book an upper cabana..plus the view is nicer and feels more private. 

They also gave us an extra fan to help. 

The cabanas are comfy though, beds were nice comfy pillows, kept very clean and a nice bathroom:)

The beach is completely deserted, so our walks were usually just us..in paradise.  Important to add..the waves in the sea, it is a surf point of course, are powerful so you can't swim or float..you can jump about in the waves which is fun just is quite tiring ha ha as you can't relax as such. ;) 

It's great breakfast is included and it's tasty..the menu is mainly Italian and its OK, some of the dishes are a little strange in flavour and personally I didn't think all worked and we really really would have loved more local food.  We had sri lankan curry one night and it was fantastic! But then the chef didn't want to cook it again:( I think this is a real shame..as its lots of pizza and pasta.  The pizzas are amazing though ..the best pizza I've ever tasted.  But we were dissapointed we only got sri lankan food once at thw resort.  But I guess for those travelling around Sri Lanka it's a lovely great If they've only been eating sri lankan.

The staff are incredible here...Harry and the other man who worked in the evening with him plus the man who cleaned the rooms..everyone was so kind, so polite, such helpful joyful people and we absolutely loved their company and help.  They work really hard and can't do enough for you. 

Harry you're wonderful! 

Nicola the owner is great, really interesting to talk to, helpful and a real passion for the paradise he's created.  Anna is also very very helpful and kind..and runs lovely yoga classes.  I'd add that I wish we'd been told about the mediation schedule when we arrived as we would have joined every morning but didn't get shown it until 3 days before we left.  More mediation would be wonderful.:)

Overall this place is paradise..I loved it..but the lack of air con was a real challenge for us BUT we did know there was none so  there's no fault of the resort..just wanted to forewarn others if going when it's hot.

We were out by 9.30am each day … and when they cleaned no surfaces were cleaned just sink washed and floor swept. You can’t have pool towels for the beach so if you are travelling with a family you have to buy four towels!

The Pool, again it’s got potential but it’s missing basic necessities- old hard/uncomfortable sun loungers with black plastic cushions (bird poo featuring), no shade available, not one umbrella for any loungers or tables on offer outside(I asked, there were none available), I mean surely this is basic? It would take so little investment to upgrade. No service at the pool. I think because it’s low grade hotel the staff (who seem to hide in a back office) don’t seem motivated to look after you. 

Sorry unless there’s a new management, or entrepreneur with vision I’d avoid if you are a family…

The selling point of the hotel is the location with it being right on the main strip. 

The rooms are very large and the air conditioning is good but other than that they're very basic and really dark! The bed was comfy but the sheets were old and felt and looked a bit dirty. The bathroom was functional but dated. We had ants crawling all over the bedside table and this hotel was the only place I got bitten while I slept despite the mosquito net. The pool area is nice but having to dodge the bird poo while sat on the sun lounger or in the pool was not enjoyable and something we haven't experienced anywhere else ever. 

The lunch menu was basic, took a long time to be made and was very small. We went for the chicken and chips as we were in a rush before a safari and it was Happy Meal size. Luckily we didn't bother with the breakfast included option and just paid for breakfast one morning which was really poor. There were much better options just outside of the hotel that are much much cheaper. 

Each evening when we came back from dinner out there was a frog in our room and all over the front door which was very annoying. 

We also found the hotel staff the most unfriendly and unhelpful compared with everywhere else we stayed. Be aware the hotel is all sand and the staff don't help with bags.

Not necessarily a problem but we were in room 1 and were woken up by the call to prayers at 5am ish as it was just so loud and took us by surprise. 

Overall we were really disappointed with this hotel. Should have stayed at the hostel we originally booked which was less than half the price!",Very average and massively overpriced!,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3348959-d8439700-r971163067-The_Spice_Trail-Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were not disappointed with our choice. The property is a nicely converted colonial era villa with a fantastic aspect and view of the coastline. From our 1st floor room with a balcony we were afforded a fantastic view of the sea and to hear the waves crashing onto the beach.  Our room was generously sized with a high ceiling and with a comfortable king bed and associated mosquito net.  It had a decent bathroom with twin basins and a rain shower. Plenty of hot water. Room air conditioning worked very well and added to ceiling fans for those who prefer, which are quieter and allow you to hear the sounds of the sea.

The property is small with only a few rooms, which assists the feeling of serenity but although small scale it is assigned with a couple of permanent staff members to service guest needs. A minor flaw was that there was no “official” way to make contact with them and there were no phones in the room or a bell to draw attention. One morning wanting a coffee (no kettles in the rooms) and after knocking on a few doors, I was forced to finally give up.  However, an hour later I was successful and finally had a delicious plunger coffee delivered to the room and foresightedly then preordered for the following morning. An a la carte dinner was also pre ordered and highly delicious curries were prepared by the inhouse chef.  We purchased a bottle of wine in town as none was available at the property, but they did stock beer. Breakfasts were also very good.

Other points to highlight include the generous gardens bordering the sea, the friendly in-house dogs and a decent pool.

We booked a deluxe king room this time, which was exactly as depicted on the website - spacious, cozy, and complete with a jacuzzi shower that made for a relaxing experience.

The highlight of our stay was definitely the Coco Spa, which was absolutely amazing and well worth every rupee; I highly recommend it! Since we checked in on a weekday, the hotel wasn’t at full occupancy, so our first lunch was served from a limited set menu. While the vegetarian options were somewhat restricted and could have been tastier, all the subsequent meals were served buffet-style with a fantastic variety and I’d give the spread a 9/10.

One of the things I love most about this hotel is how it harmoniously integrates nature into every corner, creating a perfect escape for relaxation. Although our room had a stunning balcony view of the river, we couldn’t enjoy it due to the wild monkeys.

For those looking to explore, Pidurangala is just a 30-minute drive away. We left at 4 AM, and the roads were clear, with no wildlife encounters. This location is ideal if you're planning to do the hot air balloon ride, hike Pidurangala, or visit Sigiriya.

From the moment you arrive and are greeted at reception, from the bar and restaurant staff, to those looking after our rooms and the guys working at the three pools, you are made to feel very special. All staff are very helpful and attentive and work hard to make sure everything is perfect. 

The bedrooms are simple but luxurious with everything that you could need. 

The building itself is like something from a James Bond movie, a complex hidden in the jungle with black faced monkeys swinging by the windows, and onto the balconies. The jungle and hotel are fused together, with much of the hotel, including one of the swimming pools, carved into the rock itself.  It is rather magical. 

We spent three days here and we hardly explored the hotel and grounds as we were off on safari and walking up Sigiria but there’s lots to do in and around the hotel. There’s a games lounge with chess boards and other board games if you want a little quiet time and there’s a decent gym if you want to stretch out your muscles after the long drives. 

The food in the buffet restaurant was excellent, we didn’t try the al a carte restaurant so can’t comment, but I’m sure it’d be great. If travelling with kids there’s plenty of choice so they can be brave, knowing they can always go back to their trusted favourites if getting a little tired and emotional. 

My only real criticism of the hotel is the bar area. The staff were fantastic, they couldn’t be better or more professional, but the bar area itself is a little soulless, it is large and somewhat cavernous which doesn’t make it somewhere where you want to linger and sip a cold beer. A really good pianist did his best to lift the area but it was a struggle for him. Some simple changes, some soft furnishings, and orientating the bar towards the views would have a huge impact and the bar could become a real hub for the hotel, where people could gather, relax and talk. 

But please don’t let my criticism of the bar put you off, this is a first class hotel, and I’d happily return for a much longer stay. And I will.

45 minutes after checking in the room, when we checked the bags, they remembered that the bags were not there.

Then they ask what color and shape our bags are and how many there are. When we hear that, we feel doubt about the valuable items in our bags

After that, when we went on a dinner at restaurant the capacity of the restaurant was too high and there was a long queue out side restaurant. all they are waiting for dinner. Just like a church queue.

There is only a mismanagement of the hotel, they cannot manage the amount of guests that come for dinner . They could have increased the restaurant area or allocated time for those groups. They have no desire or concern to do any of that.

They have no desire or concern to do any of that.

We had arranged to bring a cake to surprise my son at dinner time
We told that to the hotel, so they prepared to bring it at dinner time

But they forgot that too. They finally told us after the sons left at restaurant.

I came here to relax, but I haven't found a place to relax since I came here. These are the problems.

Check-in was swift, and we were welcomed with refreshments upon arrival.
The hotel had a museum-like ambiance, and the wildlife was incredible, with monkeys greeting us on our balcony each morning.

The pool, which closes at 8 PM, provided a lovely spot for stargazing in the evening.
Our room was comfortable, with a cozy bed.

The bathroom was nice, they have a bath jacuzzi overlooking the forest and wildlife. 
Breakfast was fantastic, offering a wide variety of choices.

Negative:
Where the bathroom had a jacuzzi, the shower was also part of it. You would need to climb into the jacuzzi to take a shower. This could be a health and safety issue, as it got slippery and they did not provide bath mats and enough towels, this ought to change for those guest who won’t be able to easily manoeuvre themselves into the tub.

The master light switches were behind the bed frame, this was an awkward position and not all the light worked when we first got into the room, we had to get engineers in.

Unfortunately, most of the staff (except those at breakfast) seemed quite unhappy and indifferent.

There was a lack of care in service. My friend ordered two drinks, but there was a misunderstanding, and no apology was offered. She also ordered a sandwich, which arrived about 30 minutes after my food, even though a table of eight, who ordered after us, received their meals first. Again, no apology was given. This was quite disappointing.","Nice hotel, service was ok..",2024-09,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r972526121-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our booking was through Booking.com and  as is common in Sri Lanka, we paid the full amount a month or so in advance. 

The hotel is reputedly one of the best in Sri Lanka, the jewel in the crown of the Aitken Spence Hotel group. Opened in 1995, it was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural environment; in this it succeeds very well.

However, the hotel is suffering from under investment and once away from the reception, bar and restaurant areas, this is very noticeable. And the room we were given also showed signs of dilapidation: very stained loo, cracked tiles on the floor and shower of the bathroom, no chrome left on the taps, a very scuffed bedroom  floor and furniture that looked as old as the hotel. 

We booked a Luxury Panoramic King bedroom at just over £200 per night incl Breakfast. The room was large with a wide balcony and an amazing view from the 7th floor of the Dambulla wing. Our King bed however was two twins pushed together with a groove down the middle (this was not what we expected or paid for), there was no safe in the room (one was installed a day later) and no physical information about the hotel anywhere in the room. We downloaded pdf files from their app but there was no pdf map of the hotel, no Beverage menu (just wine and cocktails) and no information at all about restaurant opening/closing times or which menu related to which dining area. In addition, there were no price or information at all about their main buffet dining restaurant. 

Our check-in experience was awful. We arrived just before 2pm after a very long drive. We finally were allowed to gain access to our room at 3.25pm. In the meantime we were not offered any drinks or snacks whilst we waited (why not???) so we ordered a very poor sandwich from room service for an exorbitant $15.5 excluding taxes and service charge. 

Breakfast was good although the buffet restaurant was crowded with queues for freshly prepared food and the service was hit or miss. Personally I hate buffet dining so we avoided the $24 per head (excluding taxes and service charge) and ate in their Asian restaurant which was much more personal, far less busy and the food pretty good. Imali our server there was wonderful and staff were generally good. 

Prices of food and drink are not cheap here (or indeed throughout Sri Lanka in 5* tourist hotels and restaurants). We holidayed in Japan in 2023 and found it far better value than Sri Lanka despite the fact typical Sri Lankans hotel workers earn around £2,400 pa. It made me wonder if Tourists and staff are being exploited to the benefit of shareholders...

In our first 48 hours we engaged with management on several occasions. They tried to improve our experience but after multiple conversations we just accepted our fate and tried to enjoy our stay as best we could. (Writing this last sentence is not a great advert for this hotel on which the Heritance brand has been built over 30 years and which the Aitken Spence group have subsequently expanded across the region). 

At check-out, the bill for food and drink was correct but there was no recognition of our unhappiness with our stay (why not???). However, at my request, they ended up deducting the cost of that awful sandwich.",Not luxury or 5*,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r971668767-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hotel is in a stunning location overlooking a beautiful lake and is within easy reach of Dambulla by taxi.
The rooms were extremely spacious and well appointed with a stunning view of the lake (room 406).
We ate at the buffet, Chinese restaurant and also tried the bar menu. All three were excellent quality and good value.
Likewise, the breakfast buffet was good but there did seem to be an issue with the coffee which was inconsistent. It ranged from undrinkable to excellent over the 3 days…truly odd!
The pool was very good as was the use of complimentary bikes that we used to do the short cycle around the lake.
The location was very good with Sygiria and game parks all within 30-40 minutes.
Finally, the staff were outstanding. They were always friendly and on hand to help. The staff at the pool bar were particularly chatty and showed a genuine interest in their customers.

The room was spacious, larger than I expected from the photos and impeccably clean and comes with a large bathroom with separate rain shower and a tub. My balcony offered a beautiful view of both the pool and lake. The pool itself is one of the nicest I’ve seen at a hotel, both long and well-maintained. 

Jetwing Lake has a strong commitment to sustainability, which is evident in their approach to amenities. Some basic toiletries, such as a comb, sewing kit, and shaving kit, weren’t provided by default. My room included a tub, but we had to call and request bubble bath essentials. These minor conveniences could enhance the overall experience.

I found the food to be somewhat lacking. All meals were served buffet-style, but the variety could use some improvement. However, the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, enhancing the hospitality experience.

For activities, there weren’t many options that suited my interests, so the stay felt a bit slow-paced for me. If you’re looking to simply unwind, catch up on sleep, or enjoy some quiet reading, this spot would be ideal. It’s also a good option if you’re in town for a cricket match at Dambulla Stadium.

One highlight was the spa. Run by local professionals, it offers services at very reasonable rates, which is rare even in Colombo. The service was excellent, making it a worthwhile experience.

I want to especially thank a supervisor at the restaurant (whose name I, unfortunately, don’t recall) who regularly checked in on us to ensure we were comfortable and satisfied.

Jetwing Lake was one of our favorites. We actually extended our stay by one night at the last minute because we loved it so much (and major props to the Jetwing team for coordinating the switch from one night at Jetwing Blue to an extra night at Jetwing Lake, and for coordinating with Jetwing Travel for our driver). 

All of the Jetwing hotels have excellent rooms, service, and restaurants. Jetwing Lake was extra special because of the location. It was beautiful and serene, with the lake nearby and really nice walking paths. It was so peaceful. The rooms were clean, spacious, and had a great view. The bathrooms also had a soaking tub in addition to the shower. The hotel had excellent facilities overall including the pool, two restaurants, and a little gift shop in the lobby with quality souvenirs. Also a rooftop bar which we enjoyed. 

As at all of the Jetwing locations, the restaurant staff deserve extra praise for being very accomodating for my mother's specific restrictive dietary needs. Not only was the food thoughtfully prepared, but the staff also made sure we felt comfortable and reassured during every meal and checked in with us frequently. We also met with the manager I believe who was very kind and thoughtful. 

Would have loved to stay here longer and will definitely stay here on my next trip to SL.

As you would expect, the hotel is set around a lake with mountains and jungle in the backdrop, views from the pool are fantastic.

The rooms were perfect, we just had a basic double room butt it was spacious and the decor was done nicely. Views from the balcony were also very nice. Bathroom was very clean and was enormous, probably as big as the bedroom. 

The hotel staff were fantastic, accommodating us in any way possible and very attentive.

We both had a full body massage which were good.

The breakfast and dinner was lovely, breakfast had a full range of options given the hotel was a bit quieter due to it not being in peak season, the Sri lankan options were my favourite.

For the evening they have a buffet every night, an a la carte menu, and a Chinese restaurant. The a la carte menu is served in the same area as the buffet which felt a bit odd. We chose to go with Chinese on the first night which was really tasty it was just a shame there was no atmosphere in the restaurant as we were the only ones in there for most of the meal. Second night we had the buffet which had plenty of variety, we both enjoyed it.

They have got a pool bar which also doubles up as the bar for the buffet/a la carte restaurants, and they have got a bar upstairs which is better for post dinner drinks, though it seemed very quiet again despite there being plenty of people staying at the hotel.

Plenty to do in the area for 2 or 3 days, Sirigiya rock, Dambulla cave temple, the hotel also have bikes to rent free of charge to explore the lake and local off road routes although we didn’t do this. You can also quite easily lose track of time by the pool.",Five stars all round,2024-08,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r966948745-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The restaurant offers buffet style and a la carte.

I booked a takeaway breakfast for one early morning start and there was plenty of food in the pack that I was able to share with my driver.

Check in was prompt, much needed after a long flight from the UK to Columbo and then a 3 hour bus ride. 

Chinese restaurant very good, able to cater for our severe gluten allergy with ease and although chicken and rice was ordered bought out noodles and other suitable dishes. 

The spicy chicken and ribs were divine but the pork was fatty and not very good, I think this is due to the quality of the available pork in the area as the flavours were fantastic.

Breakfast was great plenty of choice and fresh food cooked to order. 

The pool area was excellent the huge pool great for a refreshing dip and lounge in the sun. 

It was lovely watching the monkeys in the grounds up to mischief and the bar offered plenty of refreshing choices.

The rooms were gorgeous. We were in a superior room and it was huge with a big wrap around terrace and kitchen area with kettle and coffee machine massive bathroom with his and hers sinks, rainfall shower and luxury amenities.

Since this was marketed as a 5-star hotel, I decided to splurge a bit and treat myself! I did tons of research and read every review, as I didn’t want to leave things like wifi, AC, and hot showers up to chance—especially after seeing how some other hotels struggled with that.

Pros:
- They upgraded me—WOW! I've never been upgraded before! I originally booked a deluxe room, but they gave me an entire duplex villa all to myself. I can’t thank them enough.
- On my birthday, they surprised me by decorating my bed with “Happy Birthday” written in flowers and palm leaves. After being out the whole day, it was such a lovely surprise to come back to!
- I had dinner at their restaurant on my birthday night. I was celebrating solo, but the entire staff came up, brought a birthday cake, and sang Happy Birthday. Huge thanks to Mr. Jerald, Rasika, Ishan, Damith, Dananjaya, Nishani, Lakshara, and Campiha (sorry for butchering your names!).
- Shoutout to the front desk team, especially Dhasunika and Raj. I’d see them morning and night, and it felt like they worked 24/7! 😂
- The staff overall were incredibly kind and attentive, always smiling. Their hospitality made my stay.
- The pool had a nice partial view of the mountain, adding to the peaceful, nature-filled vibe of the resort.
- The whole place just connects you to nature—it’s perfect for a honeymoon or a getaway with family and friends. There’s even an adventure area at the back for some extra fun with friends.
- My room was huge, the wifi was stable, the AC worked great, and there was a hot shower. The bathroom was also really spacious! Since it’s in the middle of the forest, I did see 1-2 harmless insects, but that’s to be expected.
Pro tip: Wake up early to enjoy the morning breeze, the peaceful quiet, and the luxury of being in this amazing place. I absolutely loved it here!

Other comments:
These are not exactly cons. These didn’t ruin my stay at all, just small things to note.
- Sri Lanka has short power outages now and then, but they only last 2-3 minutes, so nothing major.
- The resort is a bit off the road, maybe 10-15 minutes from the main road, but that’s part of its charm, being surrounded by nature.
- The food was so-so, not the best I’ve had but not bad either. They offer buffets in the morning and evening, plus a bar. If you have the chance, it might be easier to eat outside before heading back, since it’s a bit taxing to go out again once you're settled in the resort.",A perfect birthday getaway with exceptional hospitality and nature vibes,2024-10,SOLO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d3308737-r973312581-Occidental_Paradise_Dambulla-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
