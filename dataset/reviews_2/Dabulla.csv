We booked a deluxe king room this time, which was exactly as depicted on the website - spacious, cozy, and complete with a jacuzzi shower that made for a relaxing experience.

The highlight of our stay was definitely the Coco Spa, which was absolutely amazing and well worth every rupee; I highly recommend it! Since we checked in on a weekday, the hotel wasn’t at full occupancy, so our first lunch was served from a limited set menu. While the vegetarian options were somewhat restricted and could have been tastier, all the subsequent meals were served buffet-style with a fantastic variety and I’d give the spread a 9/10.

One of the things I love most about this hotel is how it harmoniously integrates nature into every corner, creating a perfect escape for relaxation. Although our room had a stunning balcony view of the river, we couldn’t enjoy it due to the wild monkeys.

For those looking to explore, Pidurangala is just a 30-minute drive away. We left at 4 AM, and the roads were clear, with no wildlife encounters. This location is ideal if you're planning to do the hot air balloon ride, hike Pidurangala, or visit Sigiriya.

Lastly, the staff were incredibly friendly, with special thanks to Rebecca at the front desk for her exceptional assistance throughout our stay.

From the moment you arrive and are greeted at reception, from the bar and restaurant staff, to those looking after our rooms and the guys working at the three pools, you are made to feel very special. All staff are very helpful and attentive and work hard to make sure everything is perfect. 

The bedrooms are simple but luxurious with everything that you could need. 

The building itself is like something from a James Bond movie, a complex hidden in the jungle with black faced monkeys swinging by the windows, and onto the balconies. The jungle and hotel are fused together, with much of the hotel, including one of the swimming pools, carved into the rock itself.  It is rather magical. 

We spent three days here and we hardly explored the hotel and grounds as we were off on safari and walking up Sigiria but there’s lots to do in and around the hotel. There’s a games lounge with chess boards and other board games if you want a little quiet time and there’s a decent gym if you want to stretch out your muscles after the long drives. 

The food in the buffet restaurant was excellent, we didn’t try the al a carte restaurant so can’t comment, but I’m sure it’d be great. If travelling with kids there’s plenty of choice so they can be brave, knowing they can always go back to their trusted favourites if getting a little tired and emotional. 

My only real criticism of the hotel is the bar area. The staff were fantastic, they couldn’t be better or more professional, but the bar area itself is a little soulless, it is large and somewhat cavernous which doesn’t make it somewhere where you want to linger and sip a cold beer. A really good pianist did his best to lift the area but it was a struggle for him. Some simple changes, some soft furnishings, and orientating the bar towards the views would have a huge impact and the bar could become a real hub for the hotel, where people could gather, relax and talk. 

But please don’t let my criticism of the bar put you off, this is a first class hotel, and I’d happily return for a much longer stay. And I will.

Ever since I came here, the problem has continued at the reception.

45 minutes after checking in the room, when we checked the bags, they remembered that the bags were not there.

Then they ask what color and shape our bags are and how many there are. When we hear that, we feel doubt about the valuable items in our bags

After that, when we went on a dinner at restaurant the capacity of the restaurant was too high and there was a long queue out side restaurant. all they are waiting for dinner. Just like a church queue.

There is only a mismanagement of the hotel, they cannot manage the amount of guests that come for dinner . They could have increased the restaurant area or allocated time for those groups. They have no desire or concern to do any of that.

They have no desire or concern to do any of that.

We had arranged to bring a cake to surprise my son at dinner time
We told that to the hotel, so they prepared to bring it at dinner time

But they forgot that too. They finally told us after the sons left at restaurant.

I came here to relax, but I haven't found a place to relax since I came here. These are the problems.

We were thrilled to receive a complimentary room upgrade from luxury to deluxe, featuring an expansive view of Sigiriya, the ancient rock fortress, over Kandalama Lake. The room was spacious and well-appointed, providing plenty of room for everyone. The kids loved the view, especially watching the monkeys play outside the balcony. We appreciated the comfortable beds and amenities, along with the eye-catching lotus decorations.

The hotel offered fantastic family-friendly activities, including pools and daily events like live oriental music sessions. It was great to have so many options to keep the kids entertained too!

The on-site restaurant(s) had a variety of options, showcasing both local flavors and international cuisine, making mealtime easy and enjoyable. They were especially considerate of different dietary requirements, providing helpful advice and information.

I would like to extend a special thank you to the staff of Kanchana Restaurant for helping us celebrate our wedding anniversary with lovely memories. A small request truly surprised us and exceeded our expectations. It was amazing! Thank you so much.

Although this is my first review of Heritance Kandalama, we’ve visited several times over the last ten years, and each stay has been a delight! The quality of service, accommodation, and dining remains consistently high, making it our perfect choice and go-to destination.

Check-in was swift, and we were welcomed with refreshments upon arrival.
The hotel had a museum-like ambiance, and the wildlife was incredible, with monkeys greeting us on our balcony each morning.

The pool, which closes at 8 PM, provided a lovely spot for stargazing in the evening.
Our room was comfortable, with a cozy bed.

The bathroom was nice, they have a bath jacuzzi overlooking the forest and wildlife. 
Breakfast was fantastic, offering a wide variety of choices.

Negative:
Where the bathroom had a jacuzzi, the shower was also part of it. You would need to climb into the jacuzzi to take a shower. This could be a health and safety issue, as it got slippery and they did not provide bath mats and enough towels, this ought to change for those guest who won’t be able to easily manoeuvre themselves into the tub.

The master light switches were behind the bed frame, this was an awkward position and not all the light worked when we first got into the room, we had to get engineers in.

Unfortunately, most of the staff (except those at breakfast) seemed quite unhappy and indifferent.

Our booking was through Booking.com and  as is common in Sri Lanka, we paid the full amount a month or so in advance. 

The hotel is reputedly one of the best in Sri Lanka, the jewel in the crown of the Aitken Spence Hotel group. Opened in 1995, it was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural environment; in this it succeeds very well.

However, the hotel is suffering from under investment and once away from the reception, bar and restaurant areas, this is very noticeable. And the room we were given also showed signs of dilapidation: very stained loo, cracked tiles on the floor and shower of the bathroom, no chrome left on the taps, a very scuffed bedroom  floor and furniture that looked as old as the hotel. 

We booked a Luxury Panoramic King bedroom at just over £200 per night incl Breakfast. The room was large with a wide balcony and an amazing view from the 7th floor of the Dambulla wing. Our King bed however was two twins pushed together with a groove down the middle (this was not what we expected or paid for), there was no safe in the room (one was installed a day later) and no physical information about the hotel anywhere in the room. We downloaded pdf files from their app but there was no pdf map of the hotel, no Beverage menu (just wine and cocktails) and no information at all about restaurant opening/closing times or which menu related to which dining area. In addition, there were no price or information at all about their main buffet dining restaurant. 

Our check-in experience was awful. We arrived just before 2pm after a very long drive. We finally were allowed to gain access to our room at 3.25pm. In the meantime we were not offered any drinks or snacks whilst we waited (why not???) so we ordered a very poor sandwich from room service for an exorbitant $15.5 excluding taxes and service charge. 

Breakfast was good although the buffet restaurant was crowded with queues for freshly prepared food and the service was hit or miss. Personally I hate buffet dining so we avoided the $24 per head (excluding taxes and service charge) and ate in their Asian restaurant which was much more personal, far less busy and the food pretty good. Imali our server there was wonderful and staff were generally good. 

Prices of food and drink are not cheap here (or indeed throughout Sri Lanka in 5* tourist hotels and restaurants). We holidayed in Japan in 2023 and found it far better value than Sri Lanka despite the fact typical Sri Lankans hotel workers earn around £2,400 pa. It made me wonder if Tourists and staff are being exploited to the benefit of shareholders...

In our first 48 hours we engaged with management on several occasions. They tried to improve our experience but after multiple conversations we just accepted our fate and tried to enjoy our stay as best we could. (Writing this last sentence is not a great advert for this hotel on which the Heritance brand has been built over 30 years and which the Aitken Spence group have subsequently expanded across the region). 

At check-out, the bill for food and drink was correct but there was no recognition of our unhappiness with our stay (why not???). However, at my request, they ended up deducting the cost of that awful sandwich.",Not luxury or 5*,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r971668767-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probably one of the most incredible places we have been  lucky enough to stay in. The setting is breathtaking and the architectural design magnificent. 

Hospitality from the whole was truly amazing from arrival to departure. We happened to speak to Munasinghe quite a few times during our stay, he is so knowledgeable about the wildlife here and such a patient, helpful gentleman. Padmini in the gift shop has worked here since the hotel opened 30 years ago, we were so grateful to have had the chance to speak to her whilst we shopped, what a wonderful lady. We were delighted to find the homemade pineapple jam served at breakfast on sale and have bought some home; it takes us back to breakfast overlooking the lake when we eat it here in rainy Wales!

We were on a half board package, the buffet breakfast and dinner were a delight. Plenty of vegetarian options, many waiting staff and chefs ready and willing to help us. In particular we’d like to thank waiter Ravi who served us on many occasions he was so efficient yet kind and willing to chat with us when he could. 

We had interconnecting rooms that perfectly suited our needs as a family of four. Housekeeping by Sujith and Lahiru was first class, everything was immaculate on arrival and during our stay. We were even treated to towel animals which made us all smile after a busy day out and about. 

Our only regret was not allowing ourselves more time here to enjoy the hotel environment and some of activities offered by the hotel itself. We are actually in the process of booking another holiday to Sri Lanka for next summer and we are definitely going to be returning here to allow time for just that.

The room was spacious, larger than I expected from the photos and impeccably clean and comes with a large bathroom with separate rain shower and a tub. My balcony offered a beautiful view of both the pool and lake. The pool itself is one of the nicest I’ve seen at a hotel, both long and well-maintained. 

Jetwing Lake has a strong commitment to sustainability, which is evident in their approach to amenities. Some basic toiletries, such as a comb, sewing kit, and shaving kit, weren’t provided by default. My room included a tub, but we had to call and request bubble bath essentials. These minor conveniences could enhance the overall experience.

I found the food to be somewhat lacking. All meals were served buffet-style, but the variety could use some improvement. However, the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, enhancing the hospitality experience.

For activities, there weren’t many options that suited my interests, so the stay felt a bit slow-paced for me. If you’re looking to simply unwind, catch up on sleep, or enjoy some quiet reading, this spot would be ideal. It’s also a good option if you’re in town for a cricket match at Dambulla Stadium.

One highlight was the spa. Run by local professionals, it offers services at very reasonable rates, which is rare even in Colombo. The service was excellent, making it a worthwhile experience.

I want to especially thank a supervisor at the restaurant (whose name I, unfortunately, don’t recall) who regularly checked in on us to ensure we were comfortable and satisfied.

We actually extended our stay by one night at the last minute because we loved it so much (and major props to the Jetwing team for coordinating the switch from one night at Jetwing Blue to an extra night at Jetwing Lake, and for coordinating with Jetwing Travel for our driver). 

All of the Jetwing hotels have excellent rooms, service, and restaurants. Jetwing Lake was extra special because of the location. It was beautiful and serene, with the lake nearby and really nice walking paths. It was so peaceful. The rooms were clean, spacious, and had a great view. The bathrooms also had a soaking tub in addition to the shower. The hotel had excellent facilities overall including the pool, two restaurants, and a little gift shop in the lobby with quality souvenirs. Also a rooftop bar which we enjoyed. 

As at all of the Jetwing locations, the restaurant staff deserve extra praise for being very accomodating for my mother's specific restrictive dietary needs. Not only was the food thoughtfully prepared, but the staff also made sure we felt comfortable and reassured during every meal and checked in with us frequently. We also met with the manager I believe who was very kind and thoughtful.

As you would expect, the hotel is set around a lake with mountains and jungle in the backdrop, views from the pool are fantastic.

The rooms were perfect, we just had a basic double room butt it was spacious and the decor was done nicely. Views from the balcony were also very nice. Bathroom was very clean and was enormous, probably as big as the bedroom. 

The hotel staff were fantastic, accommodating us in any way possible and very attentive.

We both had a full body massage which were good.

The breakfast and dinner was lovely, breakfast had a full range of options given the hotel was a bit quieter due to it not being in peak season, the Sri lankan options were my favourite.

For the evening they have a buffet every night, an a la carte menu, and a Chinese restaurant. The a la carte menu is served in the same area as the buffet which felt a bit odd. We chose to go with Chinese on the first night which was really tasty it was just a shame there was no atmosphere in the restaurant as we were the only ones in there for most of the meal. Second night we had the buffet which had plenty of variety, we both enjoyed it.

They have got a pool bar which also doubles up as the bar for the buffet/a la carte restaurants, and they have got a bar upstairs which is better for post dinner drinks, though it seemed very quiet again despite there being plenty of people staying at the hotel.

Plenty to do in the area for 2 or 3 days, Sirigiya rock, Dambulla cave temple, the hotel also have bikes to rent free of charge to explore the lake and local off road routes although we didn’t do this.

The setting of this hotel is beautiful. You feel like you are in Africa. We were greated with a towel and a nice drink and check in was quick and alway got help with our luggage.
 The room was beautiful very clean and modern with large windows. We had a large balcony with a beautiful view. We did not like the fact that there was a drone filming around ...not very private with the large windows. I would recommend they do not allow drones near the hotel.  One night we needed towels and they never came. another night they were very quick .
The half board buffet was good. Lot's of choices for every taste. It was kind of noisy at the buffet but the staff got to recognize us and gave us our favorite table a little outside the main dinning room which was nice and a little more romantic. Staff were very polite and efficient at the buffet. I really liked the lady at the Hopper station. She was always waving and smiling ...so friendly.

The hotel is ideally placed to visit Dambulla Cave Temples, Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa and Hiriwadunna Village.
The room is modern, the rooms are bright and the bathroom spacious. Our room overlooked the lake and the beautiful 70 metre pool. 
The room had good amenities and the laundry service was quick and very reasonably prices.
The restaurant offers buffet style and a la carte. We used the buffet on two occasions - our only criticism is that some selections ran out quite early into service and there was either a very long wait for replacement or no replacement at all. I booked a takeaway breakfast for one early morning start and there was plenty of food in the pack that I was able to share with my driver.
In the evening there was a problem with mosquitos (to be expected overlooking a lake) and the hotel applied the fogging system to help reduce the deluge of the critters.
I would stay at this hotel again.","Very nice hotel with lovely rooms, great pool, in a great location and friendly staff",2024-03,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r944763165-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately we were only here 2 nights and one of the full days we were out touring so we didn’t get to spend as much time here as we would have liked

Check in was prompt, much needed after a long flight from the UK to Columbo and then a 3 hour bus ride. 

Chinese restaurant very good, able to cater for our severe gluten allergy with ease and although chicken and rice was ordered bought out noodles and other suitable dishes. 

The spicy chicken and ribs were divine but the pork was fatty and not very good, I think this is due to the quality of the available pork in the area as the flavours were fantastic.

Breakfast was great plenty of choice and fresh food cooked to order. 

The pool area was excellent the huge pool great for a refreshing dip and lounge in the sun. 

It was lovely watching the monkeys in the grounds up to mischief and the bar offered plenty of refreshing choices.

The rooms were gorgeous. We were in a superior room and it was huge with a big wrap around terrace and kitchen area with kettle and coffee machine massive bathroom with his and hers sinks, rainfall shower and luxury amenities.

My downsides are that the hotel caters for large tour groups (nothing wrong with that) but as my room is located directly above the restaurant morning and evening noise levels are excessive, even the birds and monkeys have given up.

Food was amazing with lots of choice . Staff were helpful and welcoming.
Sadly, on our second night there, the hotel had a function which had very loud music, thumping and drumming which kept me awake and despite calling reception at just before and after midnight, nothing was done. The manager told me they had had complaints from other guests too and assured me the music would be turned down and it would be finished within 15 minutes. It was just after 1 am when the music stopped which didn’t give me much time to try and get some sleep before having to be up at 6 am.

Since this was marketed as a 5-star hotel, I decided to splurge a bit and treat myself! I did tons of research and read every review, as I didn’t want to leave things like wifi, AC, and hot showers up to chance—especially after seeing how some other hotels struggled with that.

Pros:
- They upgraded me—WOW! I've never been upgraded before! I originally booked a deluxe room, but they gave me an entire duplex villa all to myself. I can’t thank them enough.
- On my birthday, they surprised me by decorating my bed with “Happy Birthday” written in flowers and palm leaves. After being out the whole day, it was such a lovely surprise to come back to!
- I had dinner at their restaurant on my birthday night. I was celebrating solo, but the entire staff came up, brought a birthday cake, and sang Happy Birthday. Huge thanks to Mr. Jerald, Rasika, Ishan, Damith, Dananjaya, Nishani, Lakshara, and Campiha (sorry for butchering your names!).
- Shoutout to the front desk team, especially Dhasunika and Raj. I’d see them morning and night, and it felt like they worked 24/7! 😂
- The staff overall were incredibly kind and attentive, always smiling. Their hospitality made my stay.
- The pool had a nice partial view of the mountain, adding to the peaceful, nature-filled vibe of the resort.
- The whole place just connects you to nature—it’s perfect for a honeymoon or a getaway with family and friends. There’s even an adventure area at the back for some extra fun with friends.
- My room was huge, the wifi was stable, the AC worked great, and there was a hot shower. The bathroom was also really spacious! Since it’s in the middle of the forest, I did see 1-2 harmless insects, but that’s to be expected.
Pro tip: Wake up early to enjoy the morning breeze, the peaceful quiet, and the luxury of being in this amazing place. I absolutely loved it here!

Other comments:
These are not exactly cons. These didn’t ruin my stay at all, just small things to note.
- Sri Lanka has short power outages now and then, but they only last 2-3 minutes, so nothing major.
- The resort is a bit off the road, maybe 10-15 minutes from the main road, but that’s part of its charm, being surrounded by nature.
- The food was so-so, not the best I’ve had but not bad either. They offer buffets in the morning and evening, plus a bar. If you have the chance, it might be easier to eat outside before heading back, since it’s a bit taxing to go out again once you're settled in the resort.",A perfect birthday getaway with exceptional hospitality and nature vibes,2024-10,SOLO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d3308737-r973312581-Occidental_Paradise_Dambulla-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a one of the relaxed weekends i had in a while.  I am so greatful to have stayed in Seerock which was a amazing little hotel with outstanding service to be offered. Away from city in the midst of total quietness is what anyone would ask for. 

Whoever read this review please feel free to check it out . I can 100% vouch for it.  

- Location - Easy to get by via Habarana. Once you are at Habarana you can reach the hotel via Tuk Tuk. Make sure to use Pick Me (Similar as Uber). Or you could even arrange a pick through the hotel who are happy to do the needful. 

Hotel is close to Sigiriya and Pidurangala as well which is a plus

Hotel was kind enough to arrange a Safari at Hurulu Park where we were lucky to see some Elephants at their own habitat. Tharanga (Safari Driver) was very well aware where to go so we would have the best experience. 

- First impression - We were welcomed by Shehara (Front Desk) witha big smile . Welcome drinks were offered & check in was pretty quick. 

- Room - A well maintained,  clean & luxurious little room with a  Jacuzzi built in . Belive me it was a perfect fit and its  suited for a family as well. 

- Food & Service- Chef Renuka and team are gifted with amazing skillset. Every dish they offered us was out of the world. 

Special shoutout to Daminda and Krishantha who served us through the stay was always happy to make sure we enjoyed each meal. 

Thank you Seerock The Kings Domain for the outstanding hospitality. This is the least I could do for the hospitality you offered.

It’s the only good thing about the hotel other than the staff. The room is actually a luxurious room but the water pressure was not that good. Also the jacuzzi wasn’t working really well. It leaked on our first night.

Pool had no view at all and the showers and the water feature was not working at all. Several pool tiles were also broken and there were many frogs inside the pool. Also it was not cleaned properly. There was no place to take nice pictures even. They’ve ample place but not maintained properly. Landscaping is nil. Also horrible wifi 

Food was the worst we’ve ever tried at any hotel. Don’t get fooled by the positive comments regarding the food. I’m pretty sure they’ve not tried star hotels before. The menu was horrible. There was actually nothing to choose from. Menu needs to change and also only the local food was okay. Other than that pastas was horrible. I had a spaghetti bolognese and it was not a bolognese at all. They just served me noodles with beef and tomato slices 🤦🏾‍♂️ 

The worst thing is we booked the hotel on full board through another app with a discount. The management refused to serve us English breakfast because we booked it on a discount. It was not mentioned anywhere at all. Also it’s very poor to treat different customers in a different way. 

The only silver lining is Shehara who tried her best to give us an enjoyable vacation but this was a disastrous vacation.

I had been trying for 3 days to get a booking confirmation from them!!! But still had NO success. I travel a quite a lot and sending a booking confirmation is a matter of few minutes usually. I was surprised why it is taking them days to send a simple booking confirmation. I have made more than 10 calls over the past 3 days to ask for the booking. Also, to my surprise I found that the last few calls made to the landline were intentionally picked up and cancelled. (This is a FIRST in many of my travels).

Also, I had the feeling that the first female agent who picked up the reservation was clueless. She was not good in her English, so I spoke to her in Sinhalese. Whenever I inquired about the booking she will reply saying it will be sent shortly. But it never came in the first 3 days. What a waste of time!

Finally on the fourth day another reservation executive picks up the call and sends me a booking for a different set of days. I tried to call and ask them to correct it. But the hotel never picked up any of their phones.

So i finally decided to cancel the booking. 
I'm sure they have made a Blunder somewhere!!!
hence this reaction! 
I have seen hotels make mistakes before but the quality hotels always try to make amends and will usually try to check with the customer and correct it.

On first impressions the villas are in an idyllic but very remote location which could be very peaceful.  Without any prior notice, we were subject to building work being completed in public areas. 3 feet away from the swimming pool/sunbeds and staff telling us they would be just unloading the truck, then half an hours work which after 2 hours they were still there. To then being told they would be 20mins. While this work was being done there was wood constantly being sawed, drilling and staple gunning. The men were video calling. Which in my swimwear made me very uncomfortable by the pool.
Alongside this the showers in our room were freezing cold and the internet didn’t work which made planning and booking anything for our trip impossible from our room or reception.
The food was average at best with little to no choice for breakfast. Which would make it very difficult if you were intolerant/vegetarian or vegan. 
Because of the remote location and area there is very little choice for food locally. So you are stuck at the restaurant in an evening again with little choice and one food menu per table, no matter your table size. With no drinks menu.
Liyya has the potential to be wonderful but has a long way to go to be 5 stars.
We were promised a refund for the 3 nights that we didn’t stay.

However, I feel there could be some additional activities available at the hotel. It would be nice to have options such as bicycle rides, a spa, gym, library, and maybe an indoor game area.

Additionally, the rooms could be improved with a larger TV, and the bathroom would benefit from having a bathtub.

We liked the architecture of the rooms and the restaurant area with the window facades. We also liked that there was no music in the restaurant area to be able to enjoy the sound of the wind, trees and animals (especially birds). Also, as the hotel has only nine rooms in total, you have a lot of privacy. Actually my friend and I have only seen two other guests one time at dinner but had the pool all to ourselves (but we have to say that we have been there during low season). The staff of the hotel is very friendly and attentive. If you have any wishes/needs they are happy to assist you with anything (e.g. the FO manager helped us to book the train from Kandy to Ella). The best feature of the hotel for us was the food, which was included in our room price for 2 nights. For breakfast they have  a Sri Lankan option and a western option (we chose the latter and enjoyed omelette and nice fruits and sweets). Dinner was excellent the two nights. Well-thought 4 course menus that are changing every day, including starter, soup, main course and desert. Every course was a gusto. Also they cook a lot with their own grown plants from the garden and you can really taste the difference between these fresh nutritious meals and the frozen fish and vegetables in Germany.  We really LOVED the food. 
The only thing we would improve is the maintenance of the hotel. The walls, windows and the pool could be cleaner. Also the sun loungers could be renewed as well as the bikes and the roof covers. 
If maintenance and restoration in the hotel would be improved, it is without doubt an amazing place.
Just a little tip on the side: the time we were there it was very windy, especially during the night. The wind was very loud and the roof cover made noises due to the wind. So if you are noise-sensitive and can’t sleep when it’s too loud, better bring ear plugs 🫠🙂",Very calm place to stay a little outside of dambulla with delicious food and lots of privacy,2024-09,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d5980996-r968233899-Kalundewa_Retreat-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large area of beautifully tended paddy fields, several very different lakes and paths throughout the grounds to walk or cycle. There are 9 rooms across different properties dotted around the grounds. All are very private. 

We stayed  as a family of 4 in the Bakmee  house (upper and lower) . It is right on a lake and the bird life is phenomenal. We had white egret, black headed ibis and hornbills filling 3 of the trees at roosting time only a couple of metres off our decking. The sound was amazing. There were lots of other birds but also water monitors, turtles, huge fruit bats, peacocks ,monkeys….. and more. 
The building was an amazing architectural piece. We felt very lucky that this was our accommodation as we hadn’t specifically chosen a room. The building is very modern and nearly  all glass so we felt very close to nature all the time. It is well air conditioned and the rooms are beautiful; glass walled, so looking straight out to nature sitting in bed when the blinds are up.

The whole estate is absolutely stunning. Cycling and walking round was fabulous and so peaceful with lots of wildlife to spot. 
The food is very good with a large menu. The service at dinner was very friendly and attentive. We took breakfast in our house which felt very luxurious. The breakfasts were vast and very tasty. 

The only down side is it needed a good clean. The blinds are old and patterned with squashed insects and we even had a ‘pressed gecko’! It has the appearance of having had a quick wipe round only rather than cleaning the corners of rooms, behind the sinks, the mirrors etc. There is an unusable outside ?shower or ? Bath. This is not clean at all and was rather unwelcoming. The inside shower is very good though. The huge panes of glass are dirty from the first floor up in the cathedral living area. I appreciate cleaning these higher pane would be hard. The utilities store for the cleaners is enroute to the main entrance of the property ; the door ajar and smells. Several features need some maintenance like faulty electrical blinds and leaking taps. Servicing of the room and clearing breakfast was intermittent and variable and the plunge pool cleaning had to be requested. We were not informed about the full potential of the place - like a separate large swimming pool at the far side of the estate or what activities we could do there- kayaking, lake boat ride etc 

Despite my negative comments above I would be back like a shot as it was the most surreal setting I’ve even been in.
It would be fabulous if the other reviews had been actioned with improvements to the general cleaning and maintenance to showcase this venue to its full potential. 

Come and stay if you like a beautiful,quiet, very different setting,very close to nature.  I suspect the experience would be very different in each of the properties here as they are all very different and situated at different parts of the estate.","Close to nature, a stunning location",2024-07,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d5980996-r962513584-Kalundewa_Retreat-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were pleasantly surprised to find that management had upgraded our room from Lower Bakmee to Kumbuk chalet, considering our privacy and the low occupancy during our booking dates.

We found the staff to be very attentive, helpful, and they were eager to make our stay more enjoyable. They also sent us a cake to our room for our anniversary. Special credit goes to the kitchen staff. The food was really delicious and presented beautifully. 

The hotel premises offer many stunning views and we felt like we were living in a village, disconnected from all the busyness outside. As nature lovers, we really enjoyed watching various kinds of birds on the premise and taking walks on the nature trails.

However, we must emphasize that the chalet was not up to a satisfactory level. The bed linens looked old (discolored), and the same goes for the towels as well. The bathroom area was the biggest disappointment. We found it very unpleasant during our stay due to the it’s dirtiness. Even the plunge pool outside was not clean. 

We believe that unless the management does a proper renovation and deep cleaning of this chalet (Kumbuk chalet) , it should not be given to visitors even at a discounted price. Moreover, the management should explain the condition of the rooms before accepting reservations.",Mixed feelings,2024-05,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d5980996-r952031378-Kalundewa_Retreat-Dambulla_Central_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We received a friendly welcome with fresh juice drinks, flowers and a candle lighting ceremony. 

The resort is set back from the busy road in a peaceful garden oasis. 

There is a large organic garden which the hotel uses for home grown produce. 

We were invited to join a mango tree planting ceremony to celebrate 9 years of business and we were privileged to be part of this. We were shown around the garden, then harvested okra and cassava and had a simple but very tasty lunch cooked with these ingredients in the garden on a simple stove and served wrapped in banana leaf. What a lovely experience! 

The accommodation is a series of lodges around the garden. They are large, clean and comfortable. We did have squirrels in the roof and a few droppings in the room as a consequence but didn’t find this to be a problem. This was a result of being in area with abundant wildlife which was lovely.

The location is a good base for Dambulla caves and not too far from Sigiriya and national parks for elephant watching.

Dambulla is a busy commercial centre with a 24hr wholesale market - one afternoon my husband ventured in to take a look around for a few hours and returned by tuk tuk. I chose to stay and relax by the pool with our children.

We had a very enjoyable visit to the cricket stadium one evening for the Women’s T20 Asia cup which happened to be on and offering free entry to promote support. 

The hotel staff were friendly but unfortunately we did find them a little inattentive when we were on site. For example, we spent a fair amount of time relaxing around the pool and no-one came to ask if we wanted drinks or snacks. Of course we could have gone and asked but to be offered would have been nicer and I think reasonable to expect in a higher end hotel, especially as we appeared to be the only guests on site that day! 
Pool towels were not offered until nearly the end if the day. 
In addition pool towels left from other guests on the previous day were not cleared away - I tidied these up myself! I do think the staff may have been distracted by the owner who was visiting that day 🤔 but …. 

Unfortunately I also have to say the food was disappointing. Meals were buffet format. The food was mostly cold and quite bland. We ate out for 2 out of the 3 nights due to this - there is quite a good restaurant just a few hundred metres up the road. 

Finally - a poor touch as we checked out was a staff member following my husband to the tip box to ensure he made a tip and then signalling to colleagues how much he’d placed in the box. Not very polite and certainly not classy!

Overall I can say we had an enjoyable and relaxing stay in a peaceful garden oasis. The staff were kind and friendly but there’s a bit of room for improvement in a few areas.",A nice resort hotel with peaceful garden. Staff friendly.

The staff really looked after us, the food was good and the beer cold.
In chatting with Siddu, about the best things to do, we ended up booking two tours, the sunrise walk up Pidurangala rock and an afternoon elephant safari. Even though we were staying at a different hotel, he arranged pickup etc. all at a really good price.
We were picked up from our hotel at 5.45 prompt both TK our guide and proceeded to Pidurangala rock, admission was 1000 or 2000LKR each. The climb was steps at first and some serious scrambling near the top. The walk, with maybe 1000 others, including rests and queuing for the difficult parts took about 30 to 40 mins. TK did the walk with us and helped us and others along the way. At the top we had the most spectacular views of sunrise and lion rock, the walk back in daylight was easier than going up in the dark.
Following on, we had a really nice breakfast in a small 'locals' restaurant and then visited the reservoir, dropped back at our accommodation. TK was fantastic as a guide and a person .
Next was the elephant safari, Thilina our guide and driver was excellent, he was very safe a careful, knowledgeable and took many short detours to places he thought the elephants may be. In total we saw 48 elephants, some only a few weeks old, to the very big ones. It was a fantastic trip, with a great guide / driver. Highly recommend this tour, it was 6 hours of pleasure and learning.
