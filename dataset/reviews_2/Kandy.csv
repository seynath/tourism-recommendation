The view, the food and the excellent service... and the rooftop bar.
And the infinity pool.
OK so this hotel has a lot going for it.

We'd booked in advance and paid a little extra for a (what we interpreted as) better room. We were a little disappointed to discover our family room was on the sub-level. Once we spoke to the reception they understood and installed us into a top floor room with amazing views over Kandy.
The food is great here. Chef will come out and say hello during dinner service. Breakfast is also excellent and swift.
Make sure you get a chance to enjoy the pool. Being on the edge of the world and looking into the busy green city is not to be missed. The pool is small and cute and only a few loungers so you need to be friendly with your fellow guests.
Also make sure to enjoy the evening sunset views from the rooftop bar. The music is good, the barmen are good, the vibe is good. It's just a good time!

Highly recommend this hotel for families and saw many couples enjoying it too.

Make sure you tip the bellboy. He's a good dude.

The rooms have international plugs, AC, minibar, hairdryers etc... the bathrooms have toiletries and everything you need.
Definitely get a tuktuk or taxi as its up a big hill. ",Luxury with an amazing view,2024-08,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r965103135-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html

Despite our initial positive impression from their rooftop bar, our stay was marred by a series of disappointments.

We booked a deluxe room with a balcony, but upon arrival, we were informed that the room didn’t have the balcony. The hotel promised us a double upgrade for the final night, but this turned out to be an empty promise. The room we were eventually given was smaller and less appealing than our original room, with a tiny balcony that hardly met our expectations.

The issues didn’t stop there. The voucher we received for the rooftop bar was misleading. We were told we would get a free drink and a 10% discount, but when we tried to use it, the staff claimed that only the 10% discount was valid and refused to honor the free drink. The food and drinks we had were subpar, with poor quality and slow service. We were also not provided an itemized receipt for our bill, which led to confusion and frustration when we were charged inconsistently with what was promised.

The staff, particularly the head concierge Nikitha, were unhelpful and condescending. We were made to feel like an inconvenience rather than valued guests. After numerous attempts to resolve the issues, including an unacceptable bill and rude service, we were eventually offered a partial discount as compensation.

In summary, our stay was plagued with poor service, unfulfilled promises, and a lack of professionalism. I would not recommend the Grand Serendip Hotel based on our experience.",Horrific,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r968933460-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html

This is BY FAR, the best hotel I’ve stayed at during my trip. Here are my reasons.
1. For the price, you get far more than you pay for. 
2. The hotel is impeccably maintained. The rooms, the restaurants, all are spotless. 
3. The view is outstanding. As I sit here at breakfast sipping my coffee, I am in awe at the beauty of the city of Kandy. 
4. The view gets better as you head to the top floor which is called the Sky Lounge. There is a bar and restaurant serving fantastic drinks along with a variety of hookah offerings. 
5. The restaurant had a wonderful breakfast buffet and the a la cart menu for dinner was fantastic as well. 
6. The rooms. I walked in and immediately felt as I have arrived to luxury.  The bed was the softest I’ve slept in during my time in Sri Lanka. This served for the best night sleep I’ve had in weeks. The sliding glass door lead to the balcony which had a great view. 
7. The pool. This was an infinity pool overlooking the city. What more can you ask for. 
8. Location. I wanted something outside the city with a nice view but also in a quiet area as noise had bothered me at other hotels. The room was perfectly silent. Exactly what I needed before my long trip home.

c.	The staffs were friendly and very accommodating to our requests.
d.	The hotel has a bar near the restaurant. The cocktails served was good. This was my personal favorite.
e.	The buffet breakfast had decent amount of food variety, mostly Indian food of course, and it was all tasty.

a.	I paid USD250 Per Night (including taxes) for the Luxury King room. Sadly, the room came with limited view of the Mountain/town.

Positives: getting here at sunset, and stunning views, lovely welcome drink. Great gym and even has a squash court. Gorgeous pool area, bit cold though as in mountains.

Negatives: got the rooms at the back of hotel overlooking road (no privacy really), and rooms smallish and bathrooms very small!  Smelly as well (think it was the toilet water, smelt like a sewer).  Nice decor and clean enough, although only an overhead rainfall type shower and no shower caps, so had to recycle one from earlier. Shower over the bath and very slippery, not safe.

Not located close to Kandy (20 minutes up a windy road), so no options for food except hotel unless you wanted to arrange a tuk tuk, which was annoying. Food in hotel wasn't cheap as they have a captive audience due to location.  Got excited as there is a nightclub on premises, but it's only open on weekends. The other bar was closed for a conference or something, so no atmosphere to speak of.  We ended up drinking with a few others on the large verandah.  Apparently they wanted to charge $20USD for corkage for the others to drink their own wine outside (even though we weren't in the bar or restaurant),

This hotel has great potential, but is sadly let down by a few things. Beautiful lobby.

Having reached it after a long day, I instantly fell in love with it. The building was a beautiful, immaculate white with the façade reminding me of colonial buildings.

Upon entering, I was greeted by the front desk on my left, a garden in front of me, and a restaurant on my right. The front desk staff made me sit comfortably in the reception area while they smoothly carried out my check in formalities.

I was then taken to my room for which I had to cross the shopping arcade and the swimming pool. The shopping arcade looked quite glitzy and had a gemstone shop from where I was almost tempted to buy a few gems/ gem – encrusted jewellery.

The swimming pool, located on the ground floor, looked ethereal, illuminated by soft lanterns placed all around it. Dip into it! It was surrounded by the garden, the Uyana Restaurant, the Tamarind Bar, the deck area and a set of rooms, making it the central feature of the hotel.

I had booked myself a Deluxe Room that overlooked the River Mahaweli Ganga, a fact I realised the next morning! A lovely bookmark, with a quote from Buddha and a Nasturtium flower tucked into it, welcomed me into my room.

The room was of an adequate size, comfortably furnished, with all amenities available, as can be expected from a good hotel. The room was quite comfortable from a sleep POV; I got two good nights of sleep here.

The bathroom turned out to be quite a different one. The bathing area was at an elevation, and one had to climb a few steps, open a glass door and step inside for a shower.
I have to admit that it was not a great design from a safety viewpoint.

Most of my meals were at the Uyana Restaurant. Indulging in its dinner buffet was one of the top highlights during my stay. You should not miss the breakfast buffet either.
The restaurant offers a delightful array of freshly – baked pastries, a variety of fruits, and a selection of hot and cold dishes to kickstart your day.

I had a drink at the Tamarind Bar too. Sprawled on an armchair, I sipped on a Mango Martini made expertly by the smiling bartender. Enjoy your cocktails while partying with friends.

And that brings me to the staff attitude. I absolutely LOVED the staff at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel. All of them were always attentive, ever efficient and tremendously cordial. Every single one of them!
I was made to feel like a cherished guest and also made comfortable as I was a solo woman traveller.

I did not use many services at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel as I was mostly out and about sightseeing, but I did avail myself of the boat cruise offering.

To summarise, Mahaweli Reach Hotel in Kandy is indeed a good hotel, known for its exceptional service and luxurious amenities. It stands out as a premier establishment.

The breathtaking view of River Mahaweli Ganga creates a stunning backdrop as you unwind and socialise in this vibrant setting. As Mahaweli Reach Hotel is located a little away from the attractions of Kandy, it serves as an ideal resting place.",Book a stay with them!,2024-06,SOLO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d316941-r968071800-Mahaweli_Reach_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html

Although we arrived a bit late, the reception staff were initially reluctant to let us join. However, Ms. Nadeesah, the  stewardess , kindly encouraged us to enjoy the buffet and assured us that she would bring some food items to our table to save time. . She fulfilled her promise, allowing us to finish our meal in just 40 minutes. If we had followed the initial advice from the reception, we might not have had the opportunity to  have th breakfast  at your hotel and would have left looking for another hotel in Kandy. 
Ms. Nadeesah's exceptional business acumen was instrumental in our decision to stay back for the buffet. Your esteemed hotel, like many others in Sri Lanka, would greatly benefit from more staff members like  Nadeesha the stewardess , who use their common sense to attract guests. We also observed her assisting other foreign guests who arrived late, ensuring they could enjoy the morning buffet as well.

As Sri Lanka strives to promote tourism and boost foreign revenue, it is essential to encourage and support dedicated individuals like Ms. Nadeesah. We wish her all a all the luck !!
We aslos wish to  mention  that the food was quite good and the Hopper makers were helpful. However  as we had overstayted for 5 minutes one steward  informed us that time is up signalling us to leave.  I wish that this gentleman could have used a much more polite tone !!
