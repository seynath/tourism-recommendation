It was a one of the relaxed weekends i had in a while.  I am so greatful to have stayed in Seerock which was a amazing little hotel with outstanding service to be offered. Away from city in the midst of total quietness is what anyone would ask for. 

Whoever read this review please feel free to check it out . I can 100% vouch for it.  

- Location - Easy to get by via Habarana. Once you are at Habarana you can reach the hotel via Tuk Tuk. Make sure to use Pick Me (Similar as Uber). Or you could even arrange a pick through the hotel who are happy to do the needful. 

Hotel is close to Sigiriya and Pidurangala as well which is a plus

Hotel was kind enough to arrange a Safari at Hurulu Park where we were lucky to see some Elephants at their own habitat. Tharanga (Safari Driver) was very well aware where to go so we would have the best experience. 

- First impression - We were welcomed by Shehara (Front Desk) witha big smile . Welcome drinks were offered & check in was pretty quick. 

- Room - A well maintained,  clean & luxurious little room with a  Jacuzzi built in . Belive me it was a perfect fit and its  suited for a family as well. 

- Food & Service- Chef Renuka and team are gifted with amazing skillset. Every dish they offered us was out of the world. 

Special shoutout to Daminda and Krishantha who served us through the stay was always happy to make sure we enjoyed each meal. 

Thank you Seerock The Kings Domain for the outstanding hospitality. This is the least I could do for the hospitality you offered.

It’s the only good thing about the hotel other than the staff. The room is actually a luxurious room but the water pressure was not that good. Also the jacuzzi wasn’t working really well. It leaked on our first night.

Pool had no view at all and the showers and the water feature was not working at all. Several pool tiles were also broken and there were many frogs inside the pool. Also it was not cleaned properly. There was no place to take nice pictures even. They’ve ample place but not maintained properly. Landscaping is nil. Also horrible wifi 

Food was the worst we’ve ever tried at any hotel. Don’t get fooled by the positive comments regarding the food. I’m pretty sure they’ve not tried star hotels before. The menu was horrible. There was actually nothing to choose from. Menu needs to change and also only the local food was okay. Other than that pastas was horrible. I had a spaghetti bolognese and it was not a bolognese at all. They just served me noodles with beef and tomato slices 🤦🏾‍♂️ 

The worst thing is we booked the hotel on full board through another app with a discount. The management refused to serve us English breakfast because we booked it on a discount. It was not mentioned anywhere at all. Also it’s very poor to treat different customers in a different way. 

The only silver lining is Shehara who tried her best to give us an enjoyable vacation but this was a disastrous vacation.

I called the hotel and checked their availability and placed a temporary booking. Then I confirmed the offer and made the payment and requested them to send the booking confirmation. 

I had been trying for 3 days to get a booking confirmation from them!!! But still had NO success. I travel a quite a lot and sending a booking confirmation is a matter of few minutes usually. I was surprised why it is taking them days to send a simple booking confirmation. I have made more than 10 calls over the past 3 days to ask for the booking. Also, to my surprise I found that the last few calls made to the landline were intentionally picked up and cancelled. (This is a FIRST in many of my travels).

Also, I had the feeling that the first female agent who picked up the reservation was clueless. She was not good in her English, so I spoke to her in Sinhalese. Whenever I inquired about the booking she will reply saying it will be sent shortly. But it never came in the first 3 days. What a waste of time!

Finally on the fourth day another reservation executive picks up the call and sends me a booking for a different set of days. I tried to call and ask them to correct it. But the hotel never picked up any of their phones.

So i finally decided to cancel the booking. 
I'm sure they have made a Blunder somewhere!!!
hence this reaction! 
I have seen hotels make mistakes before but the quality hotels always try to make amends and will usually try to check with the customer and correct it. This is a good sign of the lack of quality and lack of training of the staff.

On first impressions the villas are in an idyllic but very remote location which could be very peaceful.  Without any prior notice, we were subject to building work being completed in public areas. 3 feet away from the swimming pool/sunbeds and staff telling us they would be just unloading the truck, then half an hours work which after 2 hours they were still there. To then being told they would be 20mins. While this work was being done there was wood constantly being sawed, drilling and staple gunning. The men were video calling. Which in my swimwear made me very uncomfortable by the pool.
Alongside this the showers in our room were freezing cold and the internet didn’t work which made planning and booking anything for our trip impossible from our room or reception.
The food was average at best with little to no choice for breakfast. Which would make it very difficult if you were intolerant/vegetarian or vegan. 
Because of the remote location and area there is very little choice for food locally. So you are stuck at the restaurant in an evening again with little choice and one food menu per table, no matter your table size. With no drinks menu.
Liyya has the potential to be wonderful but has a long way to go to be 5 stars.

The room was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, which made my stay enjoyable. The location was also perfect and I appreciated the convenience of nearby attractions.

However, I believe there’s some room for improvement in the food section.I felt that the variety and freshness of some items could be enhanced. A bit more attention to the quality of ingredients and perhaps expanding the menu would really elevate the dining experience.

However, I feel there could be some additional activities available at the hotel. It would be nice to have options such as bicycle rides, a spa, gym, library, and maybe an indoor game area.

Additionally, the rooms could be improved with a larger TV, and the bathroom would benefit from having a bathtub.

Huuuge property with beautiful nature everywhere you look, which you can explore by the free-to-use bikes they offer. The view from our room into the nature and to tge mountain was beautiful.  We liked the architecture of the rooms and the restaurant area with the window facades. We also liked that there was no music in the restaurant area to be able to enjoy the sound of the wind, trees and animals (especially birds). Also, as the hotel has only nine rooms in total, you have a lot of privacy. Actually my friend and I have only seen two other guests one time at dinner but had the pool all to ourselves (but we have to say that we have been there during low season). The staff of the hotel is very friendly and attentive. If you have any wishes/needs they are happy to assist you with anything (e.g. the FO manager helped us to book the train from Kandy to Ella). The best feature of the hotel for us was the food, which was included in our room price for 2 nights. For breakfast they have  a Sri Lankan option and a western option (we chose the latter and enjoyed omelette and nice fruits and sweets). Dinner was excellent the two nights. Well-thought 4 course menus that are changing every day, including starter, soup, main course and desert. Every course was a gusto. Also they cook a lot with their own grown plants from the garden and you can really taste the difference between these fresh nutritious meals and the frozen fish and vegetables in Germany.  We really LOVED the food. 
The only thing we would improve is the maintenance of the hotel. The walls, windows and the pool could be cleaner. Also the sun loungers could be renewed as well as the bikes and the roof covers. 
If maintenance and restoration in the hotel would be improved, it is without doubt an amazing place.
Just a little tip on the side: the time we were there it was very windy, especially during the night. The wind was very loud and the roof cover made noises due to the wind. So if you are noise-sensitive and can’t sleep when it’s too loud, better bring ear plugs 🫠🙂",Very calm place to stay a little outside of dambulla with delicious food and lots of privacy,2024-09,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d5980996-r968233899-Kalundewa_Retreat-Dambulla_Central_Province.html

Large area of beautifully tended paddy fields, several very different lakes and paths throughout the grounds to walk or cycle. There are 9 rooms across different properties dotted around the grounds. All are very private. 

We stayed  as a family of 4 in the Bakmee  house (upper and lower) . It is right on a lake and the bird life is phenomenal. We had white egret, black headed ibis and hornbills filling 3 of the trees at roosting time only a couple of metres off our decking. The sound was amazing. There were lots of other birds but also water monitors, turtles, huge fruit bats, peacocks ,monkeys….. and more. 
The building was an amazing architectural piece. We felt very lucky that this was our accommodation as we hadn’t specifically chosen a room. The building is very modern and nearly  all glass so we felt very close to nature all the time. It is well air conditioned and the rooms are beautiful; glass walled, so looking straight out to nature sitting in bed when the blinds are up.

The whole estate is absolutely stunning. Cycling and walking round was fabulous and so peaceful with lots of wildlife to spot. 
The food is very good with a large menu. The service at dinner was very friendly and attentive. We took breakfast in our house which felt very luxurious. The breakfasts were vast and very tasty. 

The only down side is it needed a good clean. The blinds are old and patterned with squashed insects and we even had a ‘pressed gecko’! It has the appearance of having had a quick wipe round only rather than cleaning the corners of rooms, behind the sinks, the mirrors etc. There is an unusable outside ?shower or ? Bath. This is not clean at all and was rather unwelcoming. The inside shower is very good though. The huge panes of glass are dirty from the first floor up in the cathedral living area. I appreciate cleaning these higher pane would be hard. The utilities store for the cleaners is enroute to the main entrance of the property ; the door ajar and smells. Several features need some maintenance like faulty electrical blinds and leaking taps. Servicing of the room and clearing breakfast was intermittent and variable and the plunge pool cleaning had to be requested. We were not informed about the full potential of the place - like a separate large swimming pool at the far side of the estate or what activities we could do there- kayaking, lake boat ride etc 

Despite my negative comments above I would be back like a shot as it was the most surreal setting I’ve even been in.
It would be fabulous if the other reviews had been actioned with improvements to the general cleaning and maintenance to showcase this venue to its full potential. 

Come and stay if you like a beautiful,quiet, very different setting,very close to nature.  I suspect the experience would be very different in each of the properties here as they are all very different and situated at different parts of the estate.","Close to nature, a stunning location",2024-07,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d5980996-r962513584-Kalundewa_Retreat-Dambulla_Central_Province.html

The hotel premises offer many stunning views and we felt like we were living in a village, disconnected from all the busyness outside. As nature lovers, we really enjoyed watching various kinds of birds on the premise and taking walks on the nature trails.

However, we must emphasize that the chalet was not up to a satisfactory level. The bed linens looked old (discolored), and the same goes for the towels as well. The bathroom area was the biggest disappointment. We found it very unpleasant during our stay due to the it’s dirtiness. Even the plunge pool outside was not clean.

We received a friendly welcome with fresh juice drinks, flowers and a candle lighting ceremony. 

The resort is set back from the busy road in a peaceful garden oasis. 

There is a large organic garden which the hotel uses for home grown produce. 

We were invited to join a mango tree planting ceremony to celebrate 9 years of business and we were privileged to be part of this. We were shown around the garden, then harvested okra and cassava and had a simple but very tasty lunch cooked with these ingredients in the garden on a simple stove and served wrapped in banana leaf. What a lovely experience! 

The accommodation is a series of lodges around the garden. They are large, clean and comfortable. We did have squirrels in the roof and a few droppings in the room as a consequence but didn’t find this to be a problem. This was a result of being in area with abundant wildlife which was lovely.

The location is a good base for Dambulla caves and not too far from Sigiriya and national parks for elephant watching.

Dambulla is a busy commercial centre with a 24hr wholesale market - one afternoon my husband ventured in to take a look around for a few hours and returned by tuk tuk. I chose to stay and relax by the pool with our children.

We had a very enjoyable visit to the cricket stadium one evening for the Women’s T20 Asia cup which happened to be on and offering free entry to promote support. 

The hotel staff were friendly but unfortunately we did find them a little inattentive when we were on site. For example, we spent a fair amount of time relaxing around the pool and no-one came to ask if we wanted drinks or snacks. Of course we could have gone and asked but to be offered would have been nicer and I think reasonable to expect in a higher end hotel, especially as we appeared to be the only guests on site that day! 
Pool towels were not offered until nearly the end if the day. 
In addition pool towels left from other guests on the previous day were not cleared away - I tidied these up myself! I do think the staff may have been distracted by the owner who was visiting that day 🤔 but …. 

Unfortunately I also have to say the food was disappointing. Meals were buffet format. The food was mostly cold and quite bland. We ate out for 2 out of the 3 nights due to this - there is quite a good restaurant just a few hundred metres up the road. 

Finally - a poor touch as we checked out was a staff member following my husband to the tip box to ensure he made a tip and then signalling to colleagues how much he’d placed in the box. Not very polite and certainly not classy!

Overall I can say we had an enjoyable and relaxing stay in a peaceful garden oasis. The staff were kind and friendly but there’s a bit of room for improvement in a few areas.",A nice resort hotel with peaceful garden. Staff friendly.

In chatting with Siddu, about the best things to do, we ended up booking two tours, the sunrise walk up Pidurangala rock and an afternoon elephant safari. Even though we were staying at a different hotel, he arranged pickup etc. all at a really good price.
We were picked up from our hotel at 5.45 prompt both TK our guide and proceeded to Pidurangala rock, admission was 1000 or 2000LKR each. The climb was steps at first and some serious scrambling near the top. The walk, with maybe 1000 others, including rests and queuing for the difficult parts took about 30 to 40 mins. TK did the walk with us and helped us and others along the way. At the top we had the most spectacular views of sunrise and lion rock, the walk back in daylight was easier than going up in the dark.
Following on, we had a really nice breakfast in a small 'locals' restaurant and then visited the reservoir, dropped back at our accommodation. TK was fantastic as a guide and a person .
Next was the elephant safari, Thilina our guide and driver was excellent, he was very safe a careful, knowledgeable and took many short detours to places he thought the elephants may be. In total we saw 48 elephants, some only a few weeks old, to the very big ones. It was a fantastic trip, with a great guide / driver. Highly recommend this tour, it was 6 hours of pleasure and learning.
We got back to our hotel to find a couple who had been quoted more for the two of them to do the safari than we paid for four people for the both trips.
Needless to s at we returned the next day to eat and drink at the Sundaras.

Sri Lanka is a wonderful destination to combine a seaside holiday with some interesting stuff to do, and the Anantara was a great base for that. When we first got there after a short (90 minutes) drive from the airport it all seemed a little quiet and low key and I wasn't sure if we'd made the right choice, but as we relaxed into the rhythm of the place we enjoyed it more and more as the week went on.

The pool looks out over the lagoon so there are always things to see going on around the area while enjoying the water. There was quite a bit of rain the week that we were there but there was plenty to do in the hotel even when it was wet. For example we enjoyed playing pool in the upstairs bar and one day the manager arranged a lesson for our daughter in towel art conducted by our multi-talented room attendant Dilan. She also enjoyed an excellent, very professional art class with a lovely teacher called Rathna who came in specially from outside the hotel.

Our room was very spacious and well appointed. We tried all three restaurants, of which the Italian stood out as the best. Breakfast in the buffet was also very good as was the friendly service in the bar next to the buffet. The gym is of a high standard and well equipped.

Outside the hotel there is a small town with a well-stocked supermarket/liquor store about a twenty minute walk away on the main road. We met an autorickshaw driver called Freddy outside the hotel on our first day and he arranged a couple of interesting outings for us, one down the coast to Bentota for a boat trip and another to Richmond Castle, near which we also visited some spectacular waterfalls and a tea plantation. Freddy was a nice guy and charged reasonable prices, although he did insist on taking us to a slightly dodgy ""spice garden"" where the owner does a hard sell routine, from which Freddy no doubt earns some commission.

The only criticism I have of the hotel is that their prices for tours and activities were extremely high. This is not a huge issue though as it is easy enough to arrange your own.

Writing this makes me want to go back to Kalutara, and I hope we will one day.",Great base for a relaxing family holiday with interesting activities nearby,2024-01,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r973727814-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

We certainly experienced this at the Anantara Resort in Kalutara. Guests are greeted by female dancers dressed in traditional attire and one cannot help feel very special by this greeting as you enter the resort. Complimentary cold pressed face towels along with  hibiscus tea with a touch of cinnamon refresh you in the humidity. The ambience of the location is pure serenity and one has a choice of beach vs lagoon. Our room faced the ocean and watching the sunset was a treat from our own balcony. A walk around the premises offer some bird watching opportunities and the layout of the boardwalk embraces you along the lagoon. 
The catering staff have indeed learned how to attend to your culinary needs and tantalise your taste buds with suggestions from the buffet. We were made to feel at home amongst many guests and although our stay was for the weekend, we did feel a sense of connection with the staff who's smiles and approachability is unique to this resort. 
Our appreciation and thanks go to Mahesha who welcomed us so warmly and was very patient in answering our questions about our stay. Udeni, the hopper extraordinaire who made the crispiest hoppers, especially the most delicious pani hoppers I've had. To Kalana, Koshitha, Nadun, Anne and Deepak who were at our service when we needed verification about food preferences and fill ups of cold and warm water to keep hydrated. Our plates and cups were replenished with a great combination of food and I definitely would love to revisit this beautiful resort at some point in the future.

The Anantara Kalutara rates very highly in our opinion and it is certainly one to which we would be very happy to return.

The staff have been charming, attentive and helpful, from management (Mr Lashan Liyange) right through to the helpful concierge Nuwan and even to Mr Eric Fernando for his professional attention, despite working for the adjacent Avani hotel. 
The Chefs and restaurant manager gave individual attention and provided both superbly displayed taster menus and wonderful traditional dishes.  Our thanks go to the staff of the Olu and the Acquolina restaurants where both the service and the food was superb.

The pool villa suite was excellent and the overall feeling within the hotel and grounds was one of quiet sophistication (it was the last hotel designed by the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa).  Thank you for a very enjoyable eight days.

Tips: 
Maybe try to avoid national holidays, especially those coinciding with Poya (full moon holiday) as the hotel can become extremely busy (and, with live bands, somewhat noisy).",Another typically good Anantara Hotel.,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r970509925-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

Fortunately we had Ms. Nisansala come to our rescue. She quietly and competently sorted us out, apologised for the mistake and made sure we were taken care off though it did take the staff one hour to show us to our day room.

The chef in the restaurant was kind enought to take care of our request for vegetarian Sri lankan dishes to supplement the buffet which was curiously lacking in srilankan cuisine and vegetarian options.

But definitely the highlight of our trip was our interaction with the young server at our table, Mr Shamalan Perera who is a well spoken, cheerful and energetic young man who made sure to take care of every little need with diligence.

Anantara kalutara is one of my favourite day outing destinations with a lovely pool and has lovely large rooms.

Bad:
1.The reception was incredibly rude and mean to us. I don't know if it was because we were locals, but here’s my warning if you are planning to go for a day out: they didn’t have any changing rooms. Not even a common changing area. I asked where my sister and I could change after getting into the pool, and the two ladies at the reception pointed us to the bathroom at the entrance. It didn’t even have a shower—just toilets. They didn’t seem to care at all. The look on the senior receptionist’s face (if I’m not mistaken, her name was Thanuja) was sarcastic, and she had such an attitude. 

It cost us Rs. 6,500 per person, but it wasn’t worth the money. I checked Booking.com too, and there are many bad reviews about the reception. We had an argument as soon as we entered, and it ruined the entire mood. There weren’t even lockers or a safe place to keep our bags. They said we could leave them on the sofa in front of the reception. I think they need to understand that women can’t remove their clothes outside or change in a tiny bathroom that only has toilets. And it’s located in front of the hotel, so we had to walk all the way back to the reception to change.

2. The hotel doesn't look that good as it is shown in the photos.

Good:
1. The staff that was there in the play area (separated from a wall) was so kind to us. They only let us use the bathroom of the spa area to change. That was extremely kind. 
2. They had a lot of games to play like volleyball, badminton, table tennis, a gym, and water polo.",Disappointing Experience: Rude Reception and bad first impression,2024-09,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d316671-r967999190-Mermaid_Hotel_Club-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

The Superior Plus room was incredibly comfortable and spacious, providing everything we needed. It was clean, making our stay very relaxing. The hotel's outdoor environment is beautifully maintained and provides a serene, convenient space for guests to enjoy.

The food and variety of drinks offered were delicious. The hotel staff's friendliness made our experience even more enjoyable. 
Special mention must go to 𝗠𝗿. 𝗔𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗮, 𝗠𝗿. 𝗞𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗮, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗠𝘀. 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝘆𝗮𝗻𝗸𝗮,(𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 of the Hotel) whose activities added a fun twist to our stay, relieving any hint of boredom. Their efforts to entertain and introduce additional programs were much appreciated!

Overall the stay at the hotel was excellent. I present my idea to improve it further.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗹. Currently, it has a deserted feel. In my opinion, the presence of a group of lovely women dressed in Sri Lankan attire will enhance the impression of the Guests and it will improve the first impression of the hotel.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐬 that the use of 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐮𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 in the hotel is poor.

Need to Update Frequently on the hotel's beauty, special programs, Special Offers, customer Feedback, etc. on social media like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc.

Overall, it's a hotel that not only enhances the beauty of Sri Lanka but also leaves its guests with lasting memories.

The hotel was fully booked and overcrowded, making it difficult to enjoy any of the services.
We were excited for the buffet dinner, but it was the worst buffet I have ever had at a 4-star hotel. There was only one meat option (chicken) with no variety at all. The breakfast and lunch the next day were no better, with the fewest choices I’ve ever seen.
On top of that, there were no towels in the room when we arrived. Despite several calls to the front desk, we had to wait a long time to get them. We also asked for an extra water bottle, but were told to refill the one we had – something I've never heard from a hotel before.
The worst part was when a room service supervisor entered our room without knocking, even though we hadn’t checked out yet. It was 12:20 p.m., and my wife was still getting ready. We hadn't handed over our key cards or officially checked out, so this was completely unacceptable.
Overall, this experience was far below what we expected from a 4-star hotel. We won’t be coming back and  I would not recommend this

6. The lighting system was excellent.

7. The air conditioning system was excellent

Bad Things

3. The staff was not friendly.

4. If you pay 47,250 for a triple full board, it is actually not worth it. It is not worth more than 30,000.

5. The hot water system was not working sometimes.

I would not recommend this hotel for future trips.  Hotel looks amazing on first entry, lovely lobby, very grand.  It was raining heavily when we arrived and checkin was okay (group of 16). The first main issue is that the hotel is not conveniently located in my opinion (our tour skipped Galle and staying 1.5 hours away in Kalutura).  I expect the price was a factor in that decision for our tour.

Anyhow, once you get to the rooms and start to get in and look closely, you can see the age of the hotel and the musty smell in many areas, obviously more because of rain that night.  We ended up googling and found the hotel was built in 1983 and apparently last renovated in 1999 (before the tsunami that actually when though hotel). I expect there was some repairs at that point in 2004 also, but otherwise it's really overdue for a refresh.  They had to entire wings of this large hotel shut off and not sure they were planning on reopening, didn't look like any work was going on.  Felt quite creepy in some areas when we walked around.  The spa was badly signposted, feels like it may have moved locations, the jacuzzi for the spa clearly wasn't being used as looks abandoned. There were villas and a beach access door on one side of property that were all shut up or locked, the hotel next door appears to have closed down.  Very gloomy and depressing, so don't recommend exploring.

Rooms were okay size, bathrooms small and kinda gross, mold in the shower cubicle and screens not that nice. Well appointed amenities though, toothbrush and vanity kit etc. Door to bathroom had a glass window with a blind that had seen better days.

When the sun was out the next day, was much nice one the wet smell had mostly gone.  Pool area was nice.  Great that it's next to beach expect you can't swim in it as apparently too rough and heaps drown there, no beach to walk along, so that sucks, just rocks. So basically trapped in the complex. Prices were insane for a Sri Lankan hotel for drinks! Cocktails were Australian prices, so didn't bother trying any. Buffet was okay, extensive food options, but not actually that good and mostly cold. I got excited for crab, but then they deepfried it and provided nothing to help get the crab out of the legs that were coated in batter, very strange.  Almost too much staff, clearing plates away before you really had a chance to finish, and often getting in the way lol.  

Oh and the really annoying thing, I called to ask for some ice.  They bought to the room, and then asked me to sign the BILL!!! For ice.  It was only 240 rupees, but never in my life have I been charged for ice in a hotel. And then the day before we checked out, they rang at 12pm to ask to come and clear the bill since we were leaving next day, and my friend said we will come later. Then they called again at 230pm to ask when we were coming.  I said really, can't we just pay when we check out like normal, and they said we really prefer you to pay before.  (But what if I wanted drinks on the last day). SO anyhow, went down on way to dinner (outside) and cashier wasn't even there, so just an overall complete pain.  They also called everyone else in the tour group to settle their bill before.  Totally unheard of and I have stayed in plenty of hotels over the years. 

We ate next door at the green bamboo the next evening and it was so much better and prices normal.  Highly recommend leaving the hotel to get good prices and yummy food!",They will charge you for ice and then annoy you for payment,2024-10,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315692-r974377012-Tangerine_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

2. Whole hotel needs a massive makeover. Stained floors, walls, pool area decking lifting, paving needs a good pressure clean. Half the hotel blocked off, deserted.
3. Found the spa. The walkway to this was completely filthy with dirty pond, rotting leaves, mould covered walk way. Truly disgusting. Needless to say we didn’t book a treatment.
4. When I asked for a menu at the pool bar, barman virtually threw it at me. 
5. Drinks insanely expensive 4000 for a cocktail?!
6. Isolated location- near ugly city/ town
7. Breakfast/ dinner buffet very average
8. School groups - up to 50  children swimming in the pool after school. They were lovely , but don’t need this when trying to relax at a 4* establishment. 
Stayed for two nights on tour around SL with ‘Luxury Escapes’. They need  to seriously rethink the quality of their accomodations.

Main concern - dinner & breakfast buffet was very thin, there were no many variations & the dishes didn't complement.

However the staff was friendly, it was obvious that they were doing their best to serve the full house crowd. Nevertheless, they couldn't manage it at their best. The restaurant didn't house the full house crowd at once. Many including us had to wait for a place to be vacant to sit.

The room we had was Lagoon view, room was clean, by the looks of it, the hotel seemed bit old. For the price (I booked via Booking.com for 41K LKR), some other hotels near the colombo city have so many amenities than Avani. Disappointed in that.
The pool & the beach was very nice.

You may have to bring some sun visors for your vehicle it is burning in the parking lot. Sun will directly shine, if you checkin in early you may be able to reserve a little shaded spot among the few.

Overall, the stay was pleasant!

First night we ate in the room as the kids were tired. Room service menu is unappetitsing and limited. 2nd night was the shocker. Kids were hungry so we went to the restaurant to order from a la carte menu. 10 minutes after sitting and about to order, a server comes to us to say that unless we order a buffet, we can't sit in the restaurant. Further we need to sit by the non-aircondirioned and mosquito overrun lobby area by the BAR (with 2 kids!) and eat a la carte there! We were appalled and walked up to our room to order some rubbish from the awful room service menu. You'd think A RESORT would have better restaurant options and that the hotel's only restaurant would allow 
guests to sit and eat from the restaurant menu! We have traveled all around the world but never seen such nonsense like this. When you sit down at a restaurant to eat, you don't insult guests by asking them to leave the restaurant and eat some place else! When a complaint was made to the manager, he says we can go back in...I said No. You don't insult guests and move them in and out of a restaurant.

We booked a three-night stay on a half-board basis and received a confirmation email stating that the total cost would be approximately LKR 100,000. We paid a 50% deposit in advance.

Before our arrival, the Front Manager contacted us two or three times, and we confirmed that we would be coming for dinner. Upon arrival, however, we were greeted rudely by the security personnel, who disrespectfully spoke to my husband. When we questioned his attitude, he replied, “Because you are wearing shorts and a t-shirt. I thought you were a driver.” This was incredibly embarrassing and left us feeling humiliated. We were shocked by such behaviour and disappointed that staff would judge and treat guests based on their attire or presumed occupation.

We were then directed to Anantara Kalutara for dinner, where we were informed that our booking was only for bed and breakfast, not half-board as we had booked and received no prior communication regarding this change. The Front Manager from Avani called us and insisted that we either pay for our dinner or accept sandwiches delivered to our room. This was highly disappointing, especially as we were traveling with our three-year-old son. As a result, we did not enjoy our dinner and returned to our room, which was also quite small and uncomfortable.
They should figure out their internal management issues and should not embarrass their guests based on their mistakes.

Given the circumstances, we decided to transfer to Anantara Kalutara the next morning. The staff at Anantara Kalutara were exceptional, completely transforming our mood and providing a pleasant environment to enjoy the remainder of our vacation in Sri Lanka. I would like to extend my gratitude to Anantara Kalutara for their outstanding service, which made a significant difference in our stay.",Bad experience,2024-09,NONE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r969499774-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

Had disappointing stay.

Beautiful place but not as beautiful and big as the pictures, clean rooms, very kind housekeepers but the staff were not so friendly and tried not help, specially females! we were 2 ladies and asked for ladies pad but they gave us just 1 pad after 2 days and said they don't have any ladies pad in the hotel! how is that possible? even in every public washrooms there is ladies pad too but in a 5 star hotel.. very disappointing. the location is not closed to any pharmacy or supermarket so we couldn't buy it by ourselves and they didn't help us!

As a 5 star beach resort no seafood on the menu and also no international food. just local food full of spice and we actually didn't eat any food for 4 days!

to everything we ordered, added 30% tax and service charge. what does it mean ""service charge"" for a 5 star hotel to bring our order just to our table not even to our room?????!!!!!!

also not possible to use the beach because it was very dangerous and there was just 1 man looked at us and didn't seem to rescue us if anything happened! and just 4 unclean plastic sunbeds on the beach, so many dogs slept under them!

many many crows were all over the hotel and stole our foods and very scary but everyone just watched and didn't do anything! when we told the manager he just said we can't do anything, watch out your things!!!!

no entertainment, no music just some entertainment plans that costs a lot plus 30%!!

overall its not worth it to book this hotel. we heard there are many better hotels in the area.","not a 5 star, very disappointing",2024-09,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r968651187-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

The Good:

The hotel is well maintained. The rooms were cozy and comfortable with great amenities. The staff were friendly and helpful. And the food... We ate at the Mangrove restaurant and the food was amazing! We loved the beef stew at dinner, the prawn dish at lunch and the breakfast was plentiful with great options and delicious bread rolls.

The Bad: 

There were two things we feel like the hotel could improve on.

We had to go ourselves to order items to our room as calling the reception and/or the restaurant proved difficult as it was hard to get through to. 

Further, the AC in the bedroom seemed under powered. 

Regardless, we had an amazing stay. Thank you to the staff for periodically checking on us and trying to fix any issues that arose. The check in and check out was quick and hassle free. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The bed was comfortable and perfect for a good night sleep. And as I said before, we LOVED the food.

Starting from the Front Office, Ms. Dilhani assisted in coordinating my visit along with Mr. Amara and Mr. Chandima. I was offered a day room for my day outing as well as it was two families. (Thanks Ms. Dilhani for taking necessary steps in arranging the same) Mr. Chandima and his F&B staff did a splendid and surprising job as they have decorated our table with Birth Day decorations and also there was a small cake cutting event as well which the little one really liked.
Appreciate the kind treatment offered by Mr. Manjula, Mr. Jayatissa and everyone at F&B. Chef. Chaminda who is always with a smile was looking after the food I guess and his services are always there when ever I visited the hotel. House Keeping team and the horticulture team should be applauded for their efforts in keeping the hotel nice and clean at all times.
I will not talk about the beautiful surroundings, glamour and amenities that Royal Palms offers as everyone can witness it via their site.

Has soon as we walked into reception we were looked after, and things never changed for the fortnight we where there.
Every single member of staff had a smile on there faces and would always ask if everything was OK .
Our ground floor room(137) was spacious and clean with a great view of the pool and sea. The buffet restaurant gave a good option of breakfast, lunch and evening meals.
The pool attendants (priyantha and another guy sorry forgot his name) would always bring your towels to your sunbeds and make sure you had the same beds everyday. The drinks in the bars was plenty full and lots of choices, it was a shame you could only have 1 glass of wine with your meal. It would be good if there was an alternative to the entertainment that they put on in the lobby bar but that's me being petty.
There is no beach directly to the hotel due to the high tides but you can excess it from either end of the resort but you will have to step over a lot of rocks, unfortunately the sea is very rough and to dangerous to go into. You will get a lot of the locals wanting you to go in there shops or on their tuk tuks but with a friendly no they leave you alone or just want to talk to you.
We took the local train to Galle which was a great experience sitting with the locals but very hot and a lot cheaper than getting a taxi or booking through the rep.

We went on a tour of hill country and south west Sri Lanka probably more in the way of tourist areas, we arranged holiday and tour through Mercury Holidays, the tour was with your own driver and guide who was very good and informative, it was a 2 night 3 day tour not cheap and we were not pleased when they put us up in a poor hotel on first night, but they up for it with rest of tour 1st class all the way.
We were all inclusive the first week one glass of wine with lunch and dinner and local spirits and beer, drink wise not the best for all inclusive, my partner only drinks wine so she got 2 glasses of wine with lunch and dinner but had to sign to declare she wouldn’t drink any other alcohol. 
Second week we were half board we paid locally better option.",First visit to Sri Lanka,2024-10,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r976404382-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

Staff are amazing, it’s not save to swim in the sea but the pool makes up for that as you can walk in to it and most of the pool is only a mtr deep so perfect for small ones, it’s also immaculate and warm.
Room attendant Subasingh was amazing with different towel animals on our bed everyday.
Pool bar staff ( Dines) again excellent.
The spa needs upgrading but staff were very nice and treatments are in exspensive.

When we looked at the pool from our balcony in the morning, our loungers were covered with towels and when it rained, which happened often, the wet towels were replaced immediately.
Also big compliments to the guys from the pool bar. Dinesh and Sanath in particular sweetened our sometimes rainy days with delicious drinks.

We met the General Manager for the first time, on arrival and he was extremely welcoming and friendly. 

All three meals were sumptuous buffets and the choice of meals very well planned. Our thanks to the Chef and Sous Chefs who displayed their culinary skills very effectively.

The best experience was having wonderful, happy and courteous staff attending to us at all times, and they were very well trained to look after the guests requirements. We believe this is only possible when you have an excellent General Manager at the helm!!

Our room was located in a very convenient place with a beautiful view, and was spotlessly clean. Thank you .

We enjoyed our stay immensely and will be back soon!

We Visited the Royal Palm Beach Hotel and stayed there for two days from 31 Aug 2024 to 01 Sept 2024.
We were welcomed by the charming, Front Office Supervisor Ms Dilhani, who attended quickly and competently to our checking in. Dilhani with her charming smile, extremely helpful attitude and courtesy created an excellent first impression. Our room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the unusual and enchanting pool surrounded by the dark sandstone hued hotel buildings which are beautifully designed. 
	The breakfast, Lunch and Dinner buffets were good and the food was tasty. It speaks volumes for the expertise of the Chef and Souse Chef and experience of their staff.
	The spontaneous reaction and special treatment; given by the General Manager and Staff; including a lovely birthday cake, special table and room decor etc; when they came to know it was my Birthday; were simply amazing and also very touching. 
	We experienced something very distinctive in this hotel which we have not observed in many other hotels in Sri Lanka (we have visited many similar grade hotels over many decades with family and friends); and that was, that every member of the Staff was always courteous, friendly and with a ready smile. They treated both Foreigners and Locals the same (which is sadly rarely found in many hotels locally). They were always active, alert and looked happy. The stewards were well trained and very efficient and courteous. They were committed to their jobs and looked content at work and also understood customer service very well. Those are unique and rare features for hotel employees in Sri Lanka today, and reflect good management very clearly. 
	The General Manager Mr Ravi Kurukulasuriya whom we met for the first time was simply amazing. During our short stay we noticed his presence for short spells everywhere be it the lobby, lounge or dining area. We noticed him moving very quickly and energetically all the time which no doubt was his custom, speaking courteously with guests and checking on food in the buffet area, speaking with staff members and always personally involved with the activities going on in the hotel. He was easily and quickly contactable at any time. In my opinion his presence was felt and his imprint evident throughout the Hotel. We also noticed the presence of the tall F & B Asst Mgr Niroshan who never failed to inquire about the food and well-being from us and other guests whilst attending to matters in the Restaurant during meal times. Similarly the Managers in the Reception area made their presence felt by interacting with and attending to the guests.
	The traditional music played by a local group in the restaurant provided a pleasant background at lunch time. The features of a band playing on Saturday and a one man band playing on Sunday in the Lounge throughout the evenings were extraordinarily enjoyable.
	All-in all it was a relaxing, marvelous and memorable week end for us. We wish to thank the General Manager and all his Staff for their kind, caring, attentive and unforgettable hospitality. A big thank you to all of them. We will certainly be back.
With best wishes

The staff are incredibly friendly, courteous and helpful; particularly the concierge and reception staff; all other staff were also exceptional.

Although the main restaurant is classified as ‘buffet style’ there were at least three chefs preparing fresh food at all services; breakfast, lunch and dinner. The choice of food was very good and there was always a good selection of local dishes; be extremely wary of the innocuous chicken starter as it was the only dish that nearly beat me in terms of spiciness; I managed in the end. Although desserts were mainly European in style I have to thoroughly recommend the coconut pudding; absolutely delicious. 

There were never any issues with sunbeds and the pool staff would always ensure that you got the sunbed of choice. The freeform pool was lovely and maintained to a high standard. The pool bar was an added bonus!

The standard of the rooms was very good and, although, there were some general small maintenance issues, when reported they were swiftly sorted. During my stay I had a room change as the monsoon rains made my first balcony somewhat precarious. There are monsoons in August and the sight of horizontal rain must be seen. The bed and pillows were one of the best I have ever slept in; they are just so comfortable.

Overall a really relaxing stay and I would like to say a huge thank you and if I were to return to Sri Lanka I would seriously consider returning to this hotel.","A wonderful, relaxed, hotel",2024-08,SOLO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r965819378-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

My wife and I had the wedding of our dreams at Royal palms beach hotel on 9th Aug 2024. When beginning to look around for venues, from BMICH wedding show, I met shameel from Royal palms accidentally and first impression is very positive then we decided to book the venue same day. Around 7 pm I decided to call, and the minute I spoke with Shameel (who was very quick to respond), I knew we had found our location. To begin with, Shameel is a kind, very helpful man, who genuinely wants to make your event perfect. Shameel was very tactful and kind when explained our situation, and helped us find the perfect options for us. Honestly, absolutely everything provided exceeded our hopes and expectations. The entire process of planning was so easy – made seamless by Shameel and Amara, ( F&B Manager) Both of them made every effort to accommodate us in every way to make it the most special day for us. They were always quick to respond, making communication simple. All aspects of the contract were clearly explained, and the timeline / due dates were easy to follow. We held our reception in the stunning, tastefully, as we only had around 150 people. The table settings were gorgeous, the drinks were perfect, and the plated meals and their presentation were outstanding. I love that royal palm’s wedding packages. we didn’t have to stress about a thing! Speaking of the packages offered, royal palms has amazing options for any budget! For our ceremony, During the reception, the staff were amazing and kind to everyone, and treated us, literally, like royalty. Our friends and family raved for weeks about how incredible everything was, saying it was the perfect mix of class and unpretentiousness. Even my 18 year old cousin could not believe the quality of everything and has declared he, too, will be married at Royal palms 😂 I can recommend this venue, and all of it’s staff.

The greeting  you get when arriving at reception is overwhelming as immediately you are recognised. 
All the staff are there to make your holiday a great experience as they say the country is the pearl of the ocean. This goes for the staff as well.
Hotel and service in every department is excellent. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff.
Rooms are beautiful and comfortable and with balcony looking over the pool and the ocean.
Newly refurbed dinning room is very comfortable. Also plenty of outside dinning,
The pool is maintained by the wonderful pool boys who look after everyone with great respect always willing to help.
Sadly the beach has been taken over by the sea and not much can be done about this. But the grounds and pool are wonderful.
Made many friends of the years. The sad part is the beach boys and girls can no longer come to the beach to sell there goods. They also are very nice people who would do anything for you and treat you with great respect.
I look forward to returning as soon as possible.

Its a basic hotel, with friendly staff and a beachfront location.  The rooms are huge, either ground or first floor with terrace or balcony and located surrounding a large patch of grass with a large, well maintained swimming pool at one end.

The hotel is under new ownership and improvements and changes were being made throughout our stay.

There are no hairdyers in the rooms, but I was able to borrow one from reception for the duration of my holiday.   Rooms are cleaned and towels replaced daily.  Sometimes the sheets, pillowcases  and towels were a bit grubby looking, but we were assured they were clean, they smelt clean.

The hotel laundry service is fast, very good and  reasonably priced.

All rooms have a fridge which we were grateful for as the beer from the bar was not cold enough for us,  there was no problem in us taking unopened beers and mixers to the room to get colder.  I took some ice cube bags with me and made ice in my room too (thank goodness I did, as the ice machine in the bar was regularly out of action).  There are tea and coffee making facilities in each room ( the tea bags provided are lovely).  Bottled water is provided daily and as needed.  The water from the tap is good for making tea and coffee and brushing teeth.  There are a variety of different plug sockets in the room (UK, EU and old style round 3 pin), a universal adapter was provided.

The restaurant was OK with buffet style at breakfast with someone to cook eggs/omelette, a bit more practice is required to get fried eggs cooked to personal liking, but they did try.   Dinner was also buffet style.   The food was good, but could have been hotter at times.  Salads were fresh, soup was always tasty.  The curries and rices were delicious, I particularly liked the daal fry.   The papadums with lime pickle and mango chutney were always good.  

The hotel were trialling a set menu for lunchtime,  whereby  staff members would ask guests individually their meal preferences from a couple of choices for each course.  It prevented waste and was generally good. 

A railway line at the front of the hotel runs parallel to the beach but noise from this is minimal.  You can cross the railway line on foot, just outside the hotel for quicker access to the main road that leads to Colombo in one direction and Galle in the other.  Buses are cheap and frequent and sometimes a white knuckle experience.  There are tuktuks outside the hotel gates that for a negotiated price, will take you wherever you want to go.  

The hotel will provide a breakfast bag on request for those going on trips with early starts. 

We booked our holiday with Tui and felt it was good value.  Their excursions, however,  were over priced.  We booked a 2 night, 3 day excursion locally,  via Buddka at the Green Bamboo bar.  Our excursion was amazing value, just the two of us too, and included far more than the Tui excursion for £55 less per person.  

Finally, a shout out to Kanishka Maduvanga and Ashen Madu at the bar, Akila in the restaurant and Ragu and Bradley on reception.",Work in progress,2024-02,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d8356701-r942379462-Coco_Royal_Beach_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html

We were in room 211 from the 19th February till the 11th March 2024.
When we arrived at the hotel 6.30am in the morning, the Manager Mr Randun was waiting to welcome us such a nice man. During our stay he was always asking if all was ok and if there was anything he could do for us. He was waiting to say goodbye and wish us a safe journey home when we were leaving too.
Ragu the receptionist checked us in, such a lovely young man always had a beaming smile and so helpful throughout our stay. So was his supervisor Bradley.
We were shown to our room by the House keeping Manager Kosala yet another polite and helpful young man always asking if there was anything he could do for us.  Our room was large with a balcony overlooking the beach and sea.  All his staff who cleaned our room did an excellent job.
We went to the pool where we met more helpful people the pool attendants Nuwan, Manoj and Chandika who couldn't do enough for us and everyone else.
At dinner and breakfast the restaurant managers Akila and Suchira and their staff was so good. Nothing was any trouble to them all they wanted to do was make us happy and enjoy our meals.
The Barman who rounded off our evenings with the best cocktails ever and the best Aarack cocktail was Kanishka.
All the staff at this hotel are absolutely amazing, very hardworking and wonderful people who always greeted you with a smile and nothing was too much trouble for them.
The hotel has recently been taken over about a week before we arrived and will be renamed shortly. Already upgrades are taking place so any shortfalls will be improved.  We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

Best views of sea and sunset,[],"This is a three star hotel and so set your expectations accordingly and also that three star SL is not like the UK. The one factor that made this hotel stand out was the superb staff. Special mentions to Akila the Bar Captain who is simply amazing. Nothing is too much for him and he truly truly care about his guests. He should be in a more senior position for me and soon. The new GM (sorry no name) is brilliant. Available all the time, very visible and despite having only been there a few weeks he is making huge change and a making great difference. The brand new barman is also a breath of fresh air - bar now clean and drinks in stock and well made. 

Our first few days were a bit like Fawlty Towers with room not cleaned and drinks running out. It did though became clear why as the hotel was sold whilst we were there and the new multi millionaire owner arrived to meet the staff. In the final few days there was noticeable change - a new fence installed by the beach, new lights fitted to the pool and massive painting underway inside and outside the rooms and no drinks shortages at all. 

To be clear we  had some issues at the hotel as we were AI via TUI and there was no snack bar as advertised, drinks sid run out and also no wine on AI. The latter being due to the rising cost of wine rising (as staff told us and other guests) and not due to it never being included as the TUi rep lied to us and others about. 

Food was tasty and the masseuse was also superb with an hour full body for just £13!!!  Always plenty of beach towels and sunbeds and so never a risk to not have somewhere to lie down. Ladies on the beach by the gate are also brilliant and very reasonable for their clothing and also cheap fresh coconuts too. Don’t ignore them and share some love to them. 

This hotel has the chance to be amazing if the new GM gets supported. It’s small and so you get such a personal experience from the great staff. If it were mine I’d have the masseuse services advertised in every room with prices and also I’d get the snack bar open asap so the non AI guests will eat and drink there assuming you also get a menu with prices on display. 

If we had the final few days for the whole time then this three star hotel would have had a five rating and it was the staff - especially Aklia and the GM that gave them a four and not a three rating.

Our room was dirty-smelly curtains, stains on the walls, stains on the linen, dirty mirrors and glass door, dirty baseboards, dust and webs on lamps, sticky surface of furniture (the paint/lacquers fault) , limescale on the bathroom floor, disgusting bin in the bathroom, uncleaned surfaces under the sink and in the shower. Linen changed only once a week. Only bath towels available, nothing more. 
Food: we only had breakfasts. There were 4 types of curry which was very tasty. But basic things for europeans like cheese were missing, also the staff in the Restaurant was poor. Basics like scrambled eggs were out quickly but the staff was just standing there doing nothing instead of bringing more eggs etc. There was no water for self service, waiters were supposed to pour it but most of the times they were chatting with each other instead of doing their jobs. The coffe/tea area was dirty. The coffee was bad. 
The pool area looks very nice, there are a lot of palmtrees, but sunbeds were incredibly old and most of them was broken.
The beach was very nice but local people camping there all day long were discouraging. The were obtrusing, brazen. They kept offering some trips, clothes, they kept standing there leaning on the fence and STARING on the people on the sunbeds. It was totally creepy. Sometimes a man with a monkey on a leash and a snake in a sack was coming there too. Hotel security was doing nothing about it. Also one of the security staff kept a bottle of alcohol under his chair so... 
Most of the stuff was nice and helpful like house keeping guys and Ragu from the reception.
There are people in the hotel trying to make it better after pandemic but it will take time. It should start with a deep cleaning of the rooms and restaurant. Also the reception looks very poor and creates a bad first impression (dirty wall, sticky counter, no decorations, some old and ugly chair).

Beach towels are collected after the day, not washed but dried, and given to customers the next morning.
Rooms are not cleaning. 

Every day something keeps breaking or not working. If you ask to fix- they agree but do nothing.

I decided to take some time off to rest and do some natural treatments and see how things went.  The time there was so restful and full of the kindest people and very nice treatments. All the oil massages were great for my back pain. I learned a lot through discussions with Barnardo who manages the place, teaches yoga and also gives very interesting talks on so many different subjects.  No idea where he gets his wisdom, but guessing its a gift. I was kind of down due to my back pain but he kept encouraging me that from all he could see and tell, I for sure would get better but it was going to take time. I just want to say at the time of writing this I am 100% better and so very happy and thankful to not be in pain!

Although we don’t expect five-star standards, our past events at Jie Jie by Jetwing since 2018 had been handled excellently. However, with the recent management change, the service quality and overall experience seem to have noticeably declined.

Firstly, while Mr. Eric and Champika made commendable efforts, certain issues impacted our event.

The handling of the event’s end time by Mr. Wasantha felt unprofessional—though we had agreed on a midnight end, he began pressuring us to stop the band as early as 11:15 p.m. This created unnecessary stress and disruption.

Additionally, despite providing 10 kg of dry bites, 15 kg of guava, and 160 green apples, only a few plates were served in the Grand Ballroom, making us question if our items were served as agreed. Furthermore, staff often cleared plates and glasses without checking if they were still in use, disrupting our guests’ experience.

The driver meal was substandard, not in line with what we'd expect from a star-class hotel. Some staff members even spoke rudely to our team, including senior managers, and the overall attitude felt rushed, as if the staff were eager for the event to end. Due to the rain, we wanted to use the indoor entrance to the ballroom, but staff discouraged this, causing inconvenience.

We were also charged unexpectedly an additional Rs. 25,000 for electricity, which we had assumed was included in our package.

An extra 24 bottles of soft drinks were billed without our authorization, which led to unapproved additional costs.

There was a significant water leak in the ballroom due to heavy rain, We intended to block one door of the Grand Ball Room, but the lock was broken, the key card for one of our rooms failed, and our team had to wait nearly an hour for access. The maintenance team eventually opened the door manually, attributing the issue to a dead lock battery and an unpleasant odor in the hall, all of which affected the ambiance of our event.

Overall, despite some staff efforts, our experience didn’t meet expectations.",Disappointing Experience at Jie Jie by Jetwing,2024-10,BUSINESS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1097569-d10422418-r977107692-Jie_Jie_Beach_by_Jetwing-Panadura_Western_Province.html

We informed the front desk, and yes, they changed our room to the next door, but the AC was still the same; we just ignored it for the time being and ordered food from the hotel restaurant, which was a Chicken Fried Rice Rs.1800 with cardboard papadam and dry rice; we also ordered a boneless chicken, but the restaurant call operator asked what we meant by boneless. Wtf, the hotel restaurant doesn't know what boneless is, so we said, ""Yako, it's Katu nathi chicken,"" and he was like, ""Ahh, okay, okay.""

Still we bared everything and didn't even complain about those but when we check-out and waiting for the bill to be processed all of a sudden a hotel staff comes and says that a 'Body Lotion' is missing from the room, I was like okay so what? the person said that like I have a stolen a TV or a iron from the room, the person humiliated me Infront of my friends and other people, I have stayed in countless hotels all over Sri Lanka and I have used all the equipment's and products the hotel provides which is complimentary and which can be taken home but this hotel doesn't even let a customer who paid around 60-70k per night to take a ' Small Body Lotion' which I used during the stay, I was really annoyed and dissatisfied with the overall service the hotel gave us, idk what has happened to the Jetwing Hotel Chain.

Even the final bill was messed up; I paid the room bill when I checked in, and the final bill was only the bar and restaurant bill, but the person charged me again for the rooms and gave me a receipt for my card; again, they reimbursed the amount to my card, and I waited for more than 15 minutes, which made me think I would never come to Jetwing again or recommend anyone, not even an enemy; I hope Jetwing management looks into this.",Worst customer service in a Beautiful place.,2024-07,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1097569-d10422418-r958537569-Jie_Jie_Beach_by_Jetwing-Panadura_Western_Province.html

All the wonderful staff went above and beyond to make our stay and in particular our anniversary a truly auspicious occasion.
Duminda , kushani, Ravin, Dinnesh and all the lovely staff in the restaurant and behind the scenes were faultless .
We were given the same great room we had stayed in 12 years ago , our anniversary meal was exceptional and our overall stay most comfortable and enjoyable.
The buffet is lovely in the evenings and breakfasts excellent.
The gardens are immaculate and the beach clean and enjoyable to stroll along. The sea tends to be quite rough so not good for swimming or snorkeling at this time of year.
We will certainly be returning and hopefully sooner .
A big thank you to all.  Our only suggestion going forwards is perhaps some new poolside parasols and tables needed .","A fabulous stay , again !",2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d586453-r973942602-The_Blue_Water-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html

The front line office manager gave us the Bawa tour which was really nice, and all the meticulous details about its architectural grandeur. With regard to dinning, I wished if there could be more varieties of rice and other dishes for dinner and breakfast taking into account the Sri Lankan guests. I am saying this in comparison our dinning experiences in the year 2022 (May)

I must especially mention about G.S Sanjeewa the supervisor of the restaurant. He was such a nice company.

The  reception staff, Shakila, Chamika, and Dilshan were always on hand for anything we needed. 

The spacious rooms, with a private garden leading to the swimming pool was a dream. Clean rooms, lovely bathroom amenities, smart TV all added to the experience. The beds were so comfortable, that we slept in most mornings! Yet the staff at breakfast still accommodated past the breakfast time. The garden/pool views from the room were so relaxing, I felt like I was in tropic heaven! 

The food was mouth watering and delicious. Something I looked forward to every morning and evening. The variety of choice with the fruits and salads, the mains and desserts, everything was cooked to perfection. I have a dairy allergy, so the staff would let me know what dessert options were suitable for me.

While we wouldn't classify this as a 5-star hotel by international standards, we were very satisfied with our stay.

The hotel boasts stunning architecture, featuring large open spaces that beautifully blend the indoors with the outdoors. Although the hotel shows signs of age and could benefit from some modernization, the overall ambiance and setting were incredible.

Dining:
The hotel offers both à la carte and buffet dining options. The buffet consistently featured a mix of ""Western"" cuisine, Indian dishes, and local Sri Lankan specialties. The variety and quality of the food were excellent, with flavors that truly delighted our taste buds. The selection of beverages was also more than satisfactory.

Service:
The hotel staff were consistently friendly, smiling, and helpful throughout our stay.

Facilities:
The outdoor areas, including the beach, were clean and well-maintained. The pool was large and kept in excellent condition. There were always enough sunbeds available, and the attentive staff were quick to prepare them for us as soon as we approached.

A special thank you goes to Aruna and his team at the Pool Bar. His warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay—Aruna, a big thank you!

A Few Tips for Improvement:

- The hotel would benefit from a planned and gradual modernization process.
- The preparation time for meals and drinks in the à la carte restaurant was relatively long, even though the hotel was not busy during our stay (off-season). It might be worth considering better kitchen management. However, the wait was ultimately worth it as the food was delicious.",Wonderful Stay with a Few Areas for Improvement,2024-08,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d586453-r967677794-The_Blue_Water-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html

 It was such a beautiful function thanks to hotel staff especially   assistant banquet manager Mrs Sanjeewani Peiris and the supporting staff who gave an awesome support from the beginning. The food was fantastic and positively one of the best lunch buffets we had at our function. All the guests of our function highly praised about delicious foods, high standard of hospitality and the beauty of the hotel as the outfit and the environment was so amazing at the hotel.

Before and after the function we stayed a few days in the hotel. The hotel's location is stunning, with the beach just steps away from the rooms. The view from the executive rooms was perfect, especially during the morning and evening sunsets.

We have stayed here on many occasions and am delighted to say that standards in all areas were excellent. The GM Mr Gihan and his team work very hard to ensure all guests needs are met or exceeded and we have very good reason to say that ours were certainly far exceeded. When we arrived at Colombo airport we did so minus our luggage, and with no help form the airline to locate it or indeed to offer any emergency help. We got to the hotel frustrated and tired and were met by the the amazing serenity of the place, and from there Ms Kushani stepped in and took over. Without this amazing lady we would never have redeemed our luggage nor indeed been able to have our wedding at the sister location Glenross Living. Ms Kushani went went way beyond expectation and we will be forever thankful to her.

We found the whole team at the hotel to be extremely helpful in every respect, other people to mention are Duminda as part of the front of house staff who was always on hand to answer any queries or to ensure any issues were dealt with quickly, our housekeeper Sujit ensured our room was always immaculate and he always did it with a great big smile.

The food quality at the Blue Water is incredible, we mostly ate in the buffet restaurant and the choice of dishes ranging from western to Sri Lankan was amazing. Felis one of the restaurant managers was always on hand to make sure that you enjoyed everything.

The hotel gardens and pool area were looking really great and it is a joy to be there.

Good things:
Waiting staff very friendly.
Large room with balcony , a/c and ceiling fan. 
Swimming pool ,warm and peaceful. Over 30 sun-loungers
Did a great job of washing and ironing clothes at a reasonable price.
Food was a buffet when there were more guests and set menu when there were less.
Beautifully maintained gardens. 
Husband enjoyed his back massage. 

Not so good:
Had to be moved due to train noise ( nearest reception), Wi-Fi not working and fridge not being cold ( even in the new room the fridge was never cold enough). Wi-Fi dipped up several times over the days
This was the only place where I was bitten by mosquitoes even while wearing repellent.
Gym machines not working
No information at front desk re local activities 
Very isolated

Worse thing for us was that we would have had a 12 hour wait after check out until we were collected to go to the airport seating In reception that had no a/c or even fans. HOT moved us to Columbo so we had an air con room in another hotel in which to wait. Great service from them .

There’s a couple of little shops across the railway line which are worth a visit. Breakfast and dinner were served in the. Open air restaurant and we always found something tasty to eat. Thanks to Tharindu and Harikesh for their great service and attention to detail. If you want something special, maybe a lobster dinner, that can be arranged with the restaurant manager for a small consideration.

Right from the start with the Tamarind juice as a welcome drink to the final bill, everything was extremely personal. 

We were travelling with an 18 month old baby and special care was taken to provide us with milk and baby food at our request. 

The resort had a warmth to it only due to the staff. 

The buffets for breakfast and dinners (we took half boarding) were just perfect. Despite all of us guests being from different parts of the world they catered to almost everyone's taste.

However, the villa itself seemed a bit old and not well-maintained.

Unfortunately, we were unable to use the private pool because it didn't appear clean, despite the hotel staff maintaining it. Similarly, we avoided the hotel's main pool as it also looked less than pristine.

During our stay, we noticed that some staff members seemed to neglect local guests in favor of foreign visitors. Although the villa felt safe and private, the actions of a few staff members made us feel uneasy and dissatisfied during our two-night stay.

Overall, our experience was underwhelming, and considering the various issues we encountered, we did not find the stay worth the cost.","Mixed experience: Good facilities, but cleanliness and service need improvement",2024-05,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1591244-r949469560-Serene_Pavilions-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html

Let me share with you a few notes to give you a clear understanding about the hotel its self, the team, food and ocean)
 
The hotel is not too big, very comfortable, with a few types of rooms: from standard to presidential suit. All prices are really fine, so you can choose the best for you. The Very nice thing is that all rooms have their own ocean view! And it is amazing to see sunrise or sunset from your room.
The hotel team is very attentive and always ready to support and help. Key-persons speak very-well English, so no probs with any demands. I’d like to say that Mr Susantha – general manager is always in the hotel, controlling all processes. Mr Gishantha Withana – senior manager of the restaurant with his team is very smiley and open to show you Sri Lankan traditional food: during the lunch you will have a possibility to try seafood, chicken, fish or beef curry, very tasty and always fresh fruits and juices. Don’t forget to ask for the real Sri Lankan tea as a cocktail!) It’s really very cool and nice.    
 
One more thing I’d like to share – the OAK RAY ayurvedic center. It is located inside the hotel. Annushka – one of the best master I ever met before. First of all – he is multi-time certified professional with medical background who does different types of massage himself, Secondly – he is very nice, open, supportive and caring person. I strongly recommend to take a program during your stay in the hotel. The price is more then affordable.
 
Have a good trip!",The best week in the ocean,2024-02,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d13413633-r942720751-Oak_Ray_Haridra_Beach_Resort-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html

We had our own private pool with tiles falling apart around the edges and the pool itself had not been filtered and was full of flies and debris.
Our bed was broken and held up by a board and the edges around the bed were also broken. 
We had paid for all inclusive but unfortunately the buffet lacked variety and seemed to cater to the European clientele only which is surprising as we were expecting to eat traditional Sri Lankan food. We were told on Valentine's Day that there will be a good selection of food but unfortunately it was one of the worst buffets we had as there was only bland salads and spaghetti again disappointing.

Our recent visit to Taprobana by Asia Leisure left us with mixed feelings. We booked two rooms for a family gathering, including a birthday celebration for our kids and accommodation for our mother-in-law. While there were some positives, overall, the experience fell short of our expectations.

Firstly, the food at Taprobana was a highlight. We enjoyed well-prepared dishes that satisfied our taste buds, albeit the spread could have been more extensive to cater adequately for everyone.

On the downside, the location seemed somewhat neglected. Maintenance issues were noticeable, which detracted from the overall ambiance. Additionally, our rooms were not as clean as we had hoped, which was disappointing given the reputation of the establishment.

The weather didn't cooperate either, as it was a rainy day during our stay. This limited our outdoor activities and impacted our ability to fully enjoy the surroundings.

One positive aspect was the pool, which provided a refreshing escape despite the weather. It was well-maintained and offered a pleasant experience for both children and adults.

In summary, while Taprobana by Asia Leisure has its merits, such as good food and a decent pool, the overall experience was marred by issues with cleanliness, maintenance, and the weather conditions. For a special occasion like a birthday celebration, we expected a higher level of satisfaction.",Mixed Feelings at Taprobana by Asia Leisure,2023-07,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d7358937-r956699665-Taprobana_Wadduwa_By_Asia_Leisure-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html
