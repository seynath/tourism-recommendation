Et
Even though the hotel was not full on the day we checked-in and requesting for an early check-in about an hour before the normal time, they could not give it on time. Further the AC didn't work. The indoor outdoor  bathroom was good and the bed was good.

Lunch buffet was reasonable but nothing to rave about. Dinner choice was limited. Breakfast choice was the best of the 3 meals. 

The view from the garden was good except that the main electricity supply line on the road is a distraction to the view. 

Since there is a limited choice in hotels close to Polonnaruwa and Minneriya National Park this a hotel one would choose by default rather than choice. 

I hope with the increase if tourism in Sri Lanka the management will refurbish the hotel and increase the staff to provide a better service.",Not as good as it used to be,2024-04,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304140-d447419-r947646187-Deer_Park_Hotel-Polonnaruwa_North_Central_Province.html

From the outside it looks nice and in a good location, but CLERALY VISIBLE LACK OF MAINTAINENCE has ruined this hotel. Just before we got to the hotel there's some rain, but we did not think anything of it. When we got the room key, we went to the room, and ground floor little living room and toilet/bathroom and the bedroom was upstairs. This wasn't ideal for us because we would have preferred to have an attached toilet. Anyhow, when we checked the bed there was some animal droppings looks like rat dropping were on the bed. We called the reception BUT HAD NO RESPONSE.  

We had to go back to the reception even when it was raining to resolve this issue. Manager-in-charge I believed called Joseph assured us not to worried it is not rat and the will clean the room spot less for us. After hanging round about 30 minutes in the reception we went to the room around 9 pm and I wanted to have a shower therefore, went to the toilet/bathroom area and noticed there was no lights to the bathroom area. My husband used his mobile torch light to see what was there. Bath tub was full covered with black dead animals therefore again had to go to the reception because as usual no one answered the phone...

Second time round not only the manager, I managed to speak to the Group CEO named Mr M I M Nizar and he was trying to convince us that this hotel is in a jungle and NOT in the city of Polonnaruwa!!! According to the Group CEO, as a customer, we should expect animal droppings on the bed as well as dead animals on the floor and the bathroom area including no lights and be able to clean it ourself without making any fuss!!! I mentioned that I am a patient with heart, diabetic and several other illnesses therefore any animal bit could be very dangerous for me. He laughed say that's nothing to worry about!!! 

After so much fuss, we managed to get a temporary light fitted to the bathroom area using a black cable and a very tall dated light should not be recommended to use in a bathroom area at all.  When we looked after they finished this temporary light installation, we could not workout water was coming from the rain though the roof area including the dirt and the dead animals or the shower... We gave up having shower or bath in the end. We tried to used the wash basin in the toilet area and you could see how dirty the mirror was including the rust coming through it and my husband tripped over the cable on the floor and the temporary light switched off. We were far too exhausted by then and went to eat something from the restaurant and they charged us Sri Lankan Rupees 11,500 but hardly anything worth while was there to eat, but being so frustrated and tired we went to the room to sleep.

Next day morning, I took some pictures of the bathroom area roof and the bathtub after cleaned by the hotel staff, temporary light which was fixed to the plug point using two cables without a plug! This Hotel was breaching Electricity; Slips and trips; and HEALTH AND SAFETY Regulation and put our lives at risk. I never come a cross or heard of this kind of behaviour putting customers lives at risk to save few pence or to increase profit. Think not twice, hundred time before you put customers lives at risk like this... I only can say Group CEO and the Manager: Joseph should put themself in customer's (ours) shoes to understand is it worth killing customers for few pence of profit or cost cutting!!! 

Next day, we again mentioned this to the manager (Joseph) and he said he will do something about it. I tried to call Expedia becuase we booked this hotel from them, but not managed to speak to anyone before all my money run out from the mobile. That's worse! When we went to get something to eat before we leave the hotel, I mentioned to my husband it smell like a sewage near our room and when we checked there were some places near the footpath overflowing sewage mixed water outside from the drainages...

This is NOT A FIVE STAR HOTEL and MAY BE EVEN HELL IS BETTER THAN THIS.

I would appreciate if you could get the full refund for our stay including what we had to put up in this hotel.",Hell on earth - NOT A FIVE STAR HOTEL - BREACH HEALTH & SAFETY!!!,2024-03,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304140-d447419-r944661263-Deer_Park_Hotel-Polonnaruwa_North_Central_Province.html

My recent stay was similar.

There's no doubt the hotel looks out onto a beautiful lakeside setting, with a Buddhist wedding on one of the mornings we were there taking advantage of the nature lovers' view.

There were even some frogs croaking around teh hotel, always a good sign as to biodiversity.

Manger Joseph in the buffet restaurant had excellent English and really cared for the guests.  Since my last visit, the area had been expanded.  Food was kept warm to hot, something most like to see in buffets.

The resort has two side-by-side pools.  I did not use.

WiFi only worked outside the bar.

The room was a letdown, as it was loft style, with the bed, a small table and airconditioner up a flight of about 14 concrete stairs.  It was inconvenient at night to have to use stairs to access the toilet.  Anyone who was unsteady on their feet could fall down these concrete stairs.

The shower was roofed but had an outdoorsy feel to it.  Hot water worked well.  Downstairs only had a round table and two chairs, and a rudimentary hanging space with a couple of hangers.  A suitcase shelf was not provided even though what can be a handy feature would have fitted in the room.

The hotel’s rich history, especially the Royal Suite, added a unique charm. 

We spent a lot of time at the hotel, simply because the view was so beautiful and relaxing. 

We enjoyed a calming Ayurvedic massage in our room, which the hotel kindly arranged through a third party. The manager was also incredibly helpful, organizing a tuk-tuk tour of the ancient city, which allowed us to see many fascinating historical sites. The hotel's location is perfect and right at the heart of these sites 

The food was a nice mix of Asian and Western dishes, all fresh and delicious. The service was exceptional, especially from Arun, who made our stay even more enjoyable. His hospitality was outstanding and his cocktail-making skills are not to be missed! Particularly his Piña Colada! 

The pool and restaurant quickly became our favorite spots to unwind, especially with the wildlife around. I regularly spotted eagles, pelicans, beautiful butterflies, chipmunks and even an occasional toque macaque.

If you are looking for a serene escape with great service and a convenient location, I highly recommend EKHO Lake House!",Serene escape!,2024-10,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304140-d6921675-r972421913-Ekho_Lake_House-Polonnaruwa_North_Central_Province.html

This is probably the best plce to stay Polonnaruwa. It has the elgance of international standards. The staff is exceptionally good. They provided us with kiripidu pojawa for Somawathi temple. We feel the management is not capitalising when marketting the place. Following are some of the points they should consider for marketing:
1. The hotel is situated nearlly on top of Parakrama Samudraya lake giving magnificent views for the rooms. There are no other hotels which provides this in Polonnaruwa.
2. You can watch elephnats bathing. Ideally the hotel should have binoculors for the visitors to watch the beauty of elephant baths. 
3. The hotel seems to have built in 17th or 18th century. Queen Elezebath has stayed in this hotel in 1954 during her Royal visit to Polonnaruwa. You can book this room and use the Roayl batch tub. Unfortaullately I got to know about the room only during my stay, otherwise I would have booked this room.
4. Hotel is almost on the smae premises as King Nissankamalla's palace and parliament built in 12th century. Magnificet ruins are only few feet away.

For one person, the suite was probably 'too much' - but for the peace and various comforts, I'd gladly do it again. The restaurant seemed incredibly flexible and caring - I am so grateful to the chef and waiters for introducing me to several fresh and local dishes.  One of the highlights of my whole trip to Sri Lanka had to have been an evening's boat trip from the EKHO Lake House across the lake to see the bird islands, and, as luck would have it, a gorgeous tusker enjoying the lakeside grasses for his supper.

Our previous hotel had to cancel our transport to Echo Lake Hotel because of the previous fuel issues in Sri Lanka. My husband called Echo Lake who immediately stepped up to the plate and organised a van to be with us pdq! 
So that was our first taste of what was to be a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable stay. 

The hotel is rightly proud of it’s high food standards and we were very impressed with requests being accepted and standards surpassing expectations from the chef. Thank you. 

Our room was delightful, a home from home especially charming with signed photograph of the queen who stayed at the hotel during her visit to Sri Lanka in 1954.

The lake itself is the largest manmade lake in the world. As we arrived a fishing eagle swooped down and plucked a fish from the water. The view was pretty fantastic, tranquil and none of the smoke, from regular compost fires in Sri Lanka, made it across to us. It’s a fab place to sit and enjoy under the shade canopy with a light breeze cooling your brow.

If you can tear yourself away from her majesty’s splendid gold bathtub then visit the ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa which are quite literally on the doorstep, well the ticket office is opposite the hotel. 

We felt thoroughly well looked after by Udesh and his team who were able to give us oodles of info on the area and suggestions for easy visiting of the rather large ruined city of Polonnaruwa.  Many other trips can be arranged. We found it hard to leave the calm and comfort, however the hotel offer boat trips on the lake and were willing to organise anything you have a mind to do.

The location is stunning with a small swimming pool and restaurant overlooking the water. Multiple eagles, water birds and elephants can be seen bathing in the water from the hotel. An amazing sight.

The restaurant needs special mention. We stayed for 3 nights Half Board and every single meal was excellent. Several choices for your main meal (a western style set). Alternatively substitute for a local style curry.

We had a lake view room which was large and very well furnished. The only real let down from the hotel and why I can’t award 5 stars was our room was not cleaned for the entire stay. The first night was a confusion with the door sign to make up the room having fallen off the door and replaced with “do not disturb”.

He was there in the morning and int he evening. Nothing was too much trouble. My partner is Texan and when it comes to how is favourite drink is made can be quite vocal. The staff in the bar and restaurant were very accommodating and the food was excellent. On our first evening Chef promised us a special meal and it was excellent. Huge prawns from the lake that tasted delicious. The next day we had a Sri Lankan curry with all the trimmings. It was so tasty and we asked them to spice it up and they did it perfectly.
Highlight of our stay was the water safari that we did just before sunset. It was exquisite and so romantic and peaceful. Seeing the elephants was a joy to behold with the beautiful sunset as a backdrop. We will never forget it. This is a must do if you stay here and the canoe guys who rowed on the water safari made you feel safe during the crossing.

This reflects very poor management, and the hotel showed a lack of consideration for guests. As a result, we struggled to find alternative accommodation. The hotel then attempted to offer us a single room for four people, which was clearly unrealistic, but we reluctantly agreed given the last-minute nature of the situation.
