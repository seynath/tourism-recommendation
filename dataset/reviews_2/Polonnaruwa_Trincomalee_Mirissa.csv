We stayed in the Clove Cottage which was rustic but beautiful. It was very private with a balcony that looked out over the jungle. The gardens were beautiful with lots of different colours of the native plants. There were lots of monkeys, squirrels, peacocks and beautiful birds to keep us entertained. The staff were fantastic. They would always stop and speak to you to ask how you were going, what you were doing that day and if there was anything they could do for us. They were the absolute best. The breakfast was different everyday with a mixture of Western and traditional. They did the best scrambled eggs I have ever eaten. The pool was nice and warm so easy to get into and overlooked the beautiful gardens. 
The beach is just across the road and town is a 5 minute walk or a quick Tuk Tuk ride. There are plenty of places close by to eat or drink.
My only negative is the roof over the balcony keeps the breeze out and makes it a bit hotter but I understand the roof would be perfect if it was raining so it's not really a negative.
I would recommend this place in a heart beat and would like to thank all the staff for making our stay here so enjoyable.

When we arrived to check in the receptionist asked if we had received her message on booking.com. We had not received it, and on checking the messages at 11:30am the morning of check-in she had tried to send us a message informing us they could not give us our confirmed room we had reserved. The reason? They had given it to someone else the day before. So they had no room to give us for our reservation. They expected us to just be ok with this, we were not as we now had no where to stay. After some conversation they tried to find us alternative accommodation. The first place they took us to was a right next door but the rooms were not nice. Another one only had availability for one night (we needed 2), and another one was not near the beach (the reason we had RESERVED this hotel). After about half an hour of getting nowhere they finally offered us a room with a more expensive nightly rates for our original room rate but they only had it available for one night. This was a nice concession and we took it as the kids were getting restless and we just wanted to put our bags somewhere. Once in the room we managed on our own to find another place to book for our second night.

The only person who I will say was amazing was Lesenke (sp?) who went out of his way showing my husband to the other hotel options, setting up the room they finally gave us, getting us an extra mattress, and providing us with the wifi.

Unfortunately the whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths and ruined our first day in Mirissa. The hotel itself is in a great location, the beach is beautiful, breakfast was delicious, and the room we were in was spacious, bright, and comfortable (although a lot of ants). It’s just too bad they don’t honour their reservations.

The location is absolutely 5 stars, it has great views and it is at the quieter end of the beach which we appreciated. The staff are also very pleasant and friendly and we had nice breakfasts looking at the sea each morning. 

The property however, is full of damp, infested with ants, mosquitoes and cockroaches.  To call this a boutique spa which I have seen on other platforms is completely misleading and is quite upsetting to feel you are being so mislead after travelling from very far and spending so much money. 

Our room was on the 1st floor, it was unclean and is in desperate need of investment and renovation.  I wonder if the positive reviews are based on the other building, as they are worlds away from the building we were in.

Whilst we were there our neighbours also shared the same experience and we saw staff taking bug killer and disinfectants to various rooms.

So for a bit more accurate information for people to manage your expectations are below.

Let’s start with the good

The location is great

Breakfast with a lovely view

Lovely staff especially Sochi the manager

The bad

The rooms are infested with insects ants, mosquitos and cockroaches

There is damp and mold everywhere

The air con units are so loud it’s hard to relax on the balcony

Palm villa is very expensive for what is provided .

The whole place needs renovating and is dirty

The owner / agent Maria is very rude and arrogant. 

We didn't complain when we arrived but asked her to look at the air con unit next door as it was horribly loud. 

Aggressively she came round banging on our door and was very rude. We didn't want to speak to her again so just put up with it.

I would suggest she should learn some customer service skills as it wasn't very nice",Bug Infested room / arrogant and rude agent!!!,2024-02,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d1902973-r941773171-Palm_Villa_Mirissa-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html

Our expectations were high after going through social media and seeing the photos. On arrival, no one welcomed us. Our driver had to carry our luggage to the lobby area. Got a free room with sea view. #97  just above the gym. The room was specious but had broken luggage rack and issues with water pressure. We didn't mind it. After using the gym,  tried to take a shower but no hot water. informed the front office and the young gentleman told he will inform the maintenance. Half an hour later, since nothing happened went to reception to check. The same gentleman told they can't do anything. So I requested a room change. The receptionist told they are full and don't have any rooms available for a room change. Since we booked the room via Agoda, checked the Agoda website and to my surprise there were enough rooms to book. So I booked a room for euro 88 for one night and showed the receptionist  to give a room since I have made an extra booking. Then, a few of the management staff got involved and offered a room change. Saying they are not full and have enough rooms to move. The next day, the general manager requested us to come to his office to talk about the situation. Wonder why he didn't come to us instead.  Felt like going to the principals office all over again. After talking to GM, Mr. Liyanage  assured that a refund would be authorised to Agoda. As promised he authorised a refund for one night but the authorization was not for the euro 88 booking which I did for the night but the first night out of the tree nights block booking which was euro 65.
We feel like we were ripped off  for a hotel, which is not up to standards. Bed sheets were patched, bathroom fittings were loose, and television fittings were hanging. Staff not trained or not interested but i must say, except few hard working staff members. Kishan from the restaurant who is a hardworking person and Anupama the executive house keeper. Who had just started but tried to do everything to make our stay a good one. According to GM one of our booking came to another ota, so they couldn't refund the room night, which was booked for euro 88 but the cheaper night.

Room was spacious and clean with a wonderful view of the beach. Each room has its own private balcony or veranda where you can sit and enjoy the view of the ocean with hardly any disturbances.
Service was excellent. From the point I called Mr Liyanage for the booking till I checked out, each and every person went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. The gentleman at the restaurant named Arthur ( I think thats his name) always had our favorite spot reserved and prepared for us without us even requesting for it. The pool attendant also was exceptionally helpful.
Location is really nice with the ocean in the front and the Polwatta river on the side. Also during our stay we managed to visit Mathara fort, Secret Beach, Coconut Tree Hill & Hakgedi Ella waterfall all within half an hours drive from the hotel.
Overall our stay was extremely pleasant and if I am to point one are they can look to improve, that would be to change the menu from one day to another.

Not worth it for the price payed. This hotel should be rated 0 zero NOT 4.3.
We have visited many countries never seen a rude receptionist (both) like in this hotel. Very bad customer service. 
I am now reading some of the previous reviews where other customers have experienced the same. I hope after reading this review hotel management take proper action and train their staffs. 
We will NEVER come back to this place again. 
Before booking we saw the rating 4.3 and believed this will be great hotel. ALL FAKE. I cant believe someone rated 5 this hotel I would rate 0. 
Starting from the hallway its either broken or not cleaned. Washroom shower with mold and smell. Shower handle does not work properly. 
Shower sliding door need two people to hold and close. Balcony railings are broken, didn't let my children out for safety. 
For the wifi you need to call everytime as the password keeps on changing. Through out our stay in this hotel all I did was keep calling the reception for washroom tissue, 
water bottle, wifi  password, etc. We wasted our two days in this hotel. Most of the time NO response or they will say ""Will call you back"" and never did. 
One point we complained re their service and this is the exact response of the receptionist ""We are like this you can find another place if you don't like here"". 
After this some staffs are staring at us, we didn't feel safe in this hotel. 
PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE and DONT FEEL SAFE HERE. This is not the experience we want from SriLanka. DO NOT BOOK this hotel. First their service is really bad. 
Never seen a receptionist very rude and attitude and talking to their guest so bad-mannered
We booked halfboard and their dinner menu has only one item nothing else, and that's a pasta with Chicken. I am coming from aboard where I eat that every day 
I don't need to spend money to come Srilanka to eat pasta.
When we requested for Srilankan food they said we have to pay additional. We spoke to the receptionist and said that we didn't have any issue with other places we stayed why your dinner menu is not good. Her response was ""this is what we provide for our set menu"".
This is our 7th hotel in Srilanka and we didnt experience anything like this in any of the other 6 hotels. 
If you walk 5 min from the hotel you can get good food for reasonable price. Why I have to pay for the halfboard and additional again. Worse experience.

 Our room was a good size and had a great view of the pool and beach but the woodwork on the balcony was rotting and dangerous.

5 minute drive to Mirissa fisheries harbor from here, where all whale and dolphin watching tours starts.

We observed some damages in furniture and think it would be better to have square plug sockets in all power outlets as almost all new electronics comes with square plug tops for charging. Clean service could be a little improved. 

The main problem here is the parking. There's no separate parking space. Taking vehicles in and out is hard when there are many guests and when their vehicles are parked right outside and in front of the reception lobby and swimming pool.

It’s so compact my husband and I couldn’t pass each other without falling over. The only good thing about the cabana was the bed. It was comfortable.

Jimmy and his crew at the restaurant were a different story. Breakfast and dinner were quite good. And the service was fine. Perhaps the only redeeming feature about the hotel.

The garden is landscaped around several mature trees and the large pool, which has plenty of loungers, showers and a bar. 
The shower in our room was excellent - good power and heat. Beds hard, but very comfortable. We stayed 4 nights and the room was cleaned daily. Rooms have seating outside.  
Good access to the beach via a private path and several places to have a drink or some food are close by. The nearest, YOUR CHOICE, plays loud music all day so not exactly relaxing if you are using the Anantamaa beach loungers, but at night you can sit nearer the surf on the beach, which softens the noise. The next place down the beach (towards Trincomalee), THE 18th HOLE, had a fun, younger vibe with different stalls offering everything from sushi to burgers, pizza to tacos. Sushi was excellent. A little further down the beach was WAVES restaurant, which did some great fish/seafood, but choice of fish was limited. 
Negatives: The hotel just looks a little tired and really needs updating.  A little more attention to some details and some investment would go a long way. 
Our room was basic - some fitted wardrobes, but only a handful of hangers. No bedside lamp and little decoration on the walls. Felt a bit soulless, but it was clean. 
Breakfast was typical fare, but really  basic and not particularly appetising. Dry pastries and dreadful coffee. 4 days and the same options every day.  It was no big surprise to see that the restaurant was almost empty every night we were there - guests were obviously choosing to dine elsewhere.
The fish ponds surrounding the pool area are green and smelt stagnant - they were so murky, you can only just see the fish swimming in them. Some oxygen and a regular clean is necessary.  The pool area is great, but the bar staff play music for much of the day, the choice of which seems more for their benefit than the guests.  Looking at the guests around the pool (almost entirely elderly and families with young kids) something a little more chilled would have been preferable. The loud beat and tinny sound from the music stopped us relaxing by the pool - otherwise it could have been a tranquil place to relax.  
We were moved to a different room as our AirCon was not working. The replacement room was substandard - the bathroom door was so warped it would not close and the wardrobe door was missing. The shower had weak flow. We asked to be moved back to our original room once the AirCon was fixed, . 
There was also a wedding or party one night we were there, which took place in a function room above guest suites, so we had to endure loud base until 11.30pm. No warning of this, nor any apology when we complained to Reception. 
There is a designated beach area for the sole use of Anantamaa guests, bit it had limited sun loungers and you need to get there early to secure one. There were only four parasols and one was blown away by the wind and removed by staff, never to return.  There had obviously been an effort to clean up all the plastic rubbish from the sand, but it was just left in a big pile next to the loungers, which pretty much summed up the general feel of the hotel.","With some investment and updating, it could be so much better.",2024-08,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7079606-r968149554-Anantamaa-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

This is definitely a hidden gem in touristic Trincomalee. 

Their front office staff service is great. Dinesh & other staff whose names I forgot were very helpful. One of our room's AC wasn't working, so they quickly changed and offered a different room. 

Rooms were clean, bathroom is big enough. Pool is clean & good for nice swim in hot Trinco weather.

We wanted to check out early in the morning, staff arranged us packed breakfast. Very thoughtful & nice gesture.

Only negative I could say is water pressure in shower was so damn slow.

Rooms were nice and comfortable with great service by the staff.

We really felt cheated and disappointed when they served just a watery vegetable soup with 4 bowls of salads of mediocre quality and 5 dishes as the mains, where 2 dishes were plain rice and fried rice-out of the 5 dishes.Desert was just ice cream and curd., this too on the 24th of December dinner when guests expected a better spread than this, on Christmas Eve. Even more, we had to stand near the buffet and wait till the dishes were refilled even though they had just 5-6 varieties to refill, but they ran out of food,half way through the evening. The next dinner was even worse with just 2 Salads and just ice cream as the desert. Obviously the management was aware of the situation but they kept passing the ball towards each other instead of making amends.

1.	Good Points
a.	This hotel is situated well beside the sea. 5-10Min walk to food restaurants.
b.	The room and toilet were clean.
c.	The staffs were friendly and very accommodating to our requests.
d.	The hotel has a bar overseeing the beach. This was my personal favorite.
e.	The buffet breakfast had decent amount of food variety, mostly Indian food of course, and it was all tasty.

2.	Bad Points
a.	I paid USD200 Per Night (including taxes) for the Superior room. Sadly, the room came with limited view of the beach. My room’s balcony was facing the swimming pool and had many trees, thus blocking my view of the beach.
b.	The hotel does have a swimming pool, but you wouldn’t want to swim in it. There are plenty of stray dogs within the hotel compound, and it pisses in the swimming pool, licks the water from the swimming pool and jumps into the swimming pool, when there's no crowd. 
c.	Black crows are also aplenty within the hotel compound, and licks the water from the swimming pool too.
d.	The beach and sea is just OK, nothing great.

3.	Will I return again to this hotel?
No.",Nice Hotel But Can Be Better,2024-10,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r974409672-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

I booked the hotel online through Cinnamon call center and paid more than half of the reservation amount but when I went to check in they couldn't find my reservation details. So I think they made a new bill. So when I was checking out they gave me a bill without deducting the amount I paid for the reservation online. So I had to show them the Email I received and send a copy of the reservation details to one of the receptionists' WhatsApp to confirm the first payment I made for the booking. It took time and I was waiting with my 2-year-old child to finish this up in the reception area. Then they gave me a new bill with the deducted amount. Then I paid through my card and the amount was deducted from my account but they said that they didn’t receive the amount. It was a just WTF moment for me. I called the bank from my side and they said the amount was deducted from your side and received by the merchant too but the hotel staff refused to accept it. So I have to spend another few hours there with my baby. They came to me and said they hadn’t received the money multiple times but the bank from my side confirmed that they had received the amount. It was not my fault. Finally, the hotel staff has to reverse the payment through the POS system. So that means they have received the amount but I didn’t show up from there said. So It’s completely their fault. The bank also informed me after I got the payment back that my payment had gone through. So the payment reversal is also done by the hotel not by the bank. So it was not the bank or my card’s fault. So I have to spend over 2 hours in the reception. They didn’t even give us a drink while we were waiting. I have gone to so many hotels but this behavior is not acceptable. They should make the guests comfortable. Mistakes can happen they should not make the guest feel uncomfortable. This is my first visit to a cinnamon hotel and the experience is not good.

Given my trust in the Cinnamon Hotels chain and its connection to John Keells Holdings, I was confident it would meet our expectations. We reserved a Superior Ocean View Room, but unfortunately, the experience was far from smooth.

Upon checking in around 5 p.m., the room’s air conditioning wasn’t working. Despite informing the staff immediately, it took several hours to resolve the issue and even longer for them to decide to offer us an alternative room. The substitute room, however, came with its own problems—it was infested with mosquitoes. Although we requested and received a vaporizer, this should have been proactively provided, given the situation.

Additionally, the washrooms were not well-maintained, which further added to the disappointment. For a hotel of this caliber, I expected much better attention to detail and more efficient problem-solving. Overall, the stay did not live up to the standards I anticipated.",Disappointing stay despite trusted brand: Issues with Room and Maintenance at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon,2024-10,BUSINESS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r973021635-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

Check-in was smooth and we were given lovely cold cinnamon welcome drinks on arrival. We stayed in room 402, which offered both pool and sea views. The direct access to the beach was great and we enjoyed being able to step out onto the beach at anytime. The beach was clean, there were plenty of sunbeds available and the pool/beach staff were very helpful in providing beach towels and sunbed mattresses. We were also able to order drinks that were brought over to us on the beach. We enjoyed lovely sunrise and evening walks along the beach. The breakfast and dinner buffets had a wide variety and we enjoyed our meals during our stay. We also had lunch at The Crab twice and the food and drinks were very good. The staff in both restaurants were friendly and accommodating. 

The hotel needs updating as some parts look tired and worn out, including the mirrors behind the reception desks, this is important for first impressions. Although there is a light natural breeze at the entrance, ceiling fans would help keep the area and guests cooler when checking-in and out. Housekeeping is offered twice daily, which is helpful given the mess that can come into your room following an afternoon at the beach. We personally wouldn't have minded if the room had a broom, so we could sweep up sand etc. after ourselves rather than wait for housekeeping later in the day. A mat or towel by the beach entrance door would also be good to wipe your feet after rinsing off before stepping into your room. The ceiling shower and toiletries were good, we felt it would have been useful to also have a handheld shower to rinse off the shower area once finished. The bins in the room and bathroom were rusty and could easily be replaced. We found the live music at dinner to be a little loud and not to everyone's taste. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful when needed.

Trinco Blu’s approach might disguise you but as you enter you know you have reached the most lovable location for your vacation. I have decided to review on different parameters from now on, here it is:
Reception &checkin- A smiling and warm reception, cold and sweet passion fruit welcome drink, checkin smooth. Rated 5 on a scale of 1-5
Room- small compact room, little crowded, first floor, sea facing, quite airy, very effective Aircon, Tea coffee maker with sachets. Sitting are outside the room with two chairs, small table, and a lying down cushion. Rated 4.5
Bathroom- a large bathroom and an open air shower. Basics provided in the bathroom (bottled shampoo, shower gel and body lotion) , warm tab provides lukewarm water only. Rated-4
Food- Breakfast was better than dinner. Though they have a separate restaurant for seafood may be that is the reason the seafood was just for namesake in the buffet dinner. Everything was tasty and displayed professionally. Rated - 4.5
Bar- non air conditioning area with fans, open to the lawns, carry your drink anywhere. We tried a special Sri Lankan liqueur branded Narikela, we both fell in love with the drink and later bought one from the market for the rest of the trip. Rated- 5
Hospitality and Service- A very polite and service oriented staff. A special mention of Pratheep and Ursula at the reception. Rated- 5
Overall rating- overall I will rate Trincomalee Blu at 4.7 out of five. 
Suggestions for travellers: Dolphin watching is fun especially when you are with kids but don’t fall for the random guy who reaches you on the sea shore and offers cheap price. Always reach out to the hotel and book from them, though expensive but suggested for safety and other reasons.","Lovely location, sea lover’s paradise",2024-08,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r967278960-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

As non expatriate locals living in Sri Lanka the half board price was pretty steep for us. But we indulged and splurged as the place looked amazing. As did the ocean

TRINCO BLU didnt fail to disappoint 
Firstly the superior room was very well maintained, clean and had a great view and ambience similar to the hotel. Very relaxed vibes. Pool was well equipped with showers, towels and constantly kept clean. Beach was similarly upkept with no touts and pristine white sand. Blessed with an ocean of dreams. I've never seen a sea more blue where you could wade out to calm waters for miles. 

Buffet of dinner and breakfast were top class. 10/10 Cinnamon! Me being a foodie i have to say the variety was unmatchable. we had delicious crab, squid, fish and a variety of meat preparations. International buffet with Indian western and fabulous traditional Eastern province local preparations. Breakfast on a Thursday had freshly made hoppers pol rotti and even a fabulous ""Diya Buth"". Apart from the traditional English breakfast specials there was an area traditional sweet milk rice as well. Very large and lavish spread!

Last but not least staff hospitality was excellent. From reception to dining staff everyone was courteous and accommodative. We checked out on Friday at 12pm and hung around for our train till 7pm. We were even given a proper room space for the ten min of prayers we required without shoving us into an odd corner. This I thought was next level. In a hotel at capacity bookings with foreign guests the care shown to the few locals was truly commendable. Much respect and love.

It must be mentioned the Live music singer was one of the best iv heard, singing local songs and a vocal range covering Guns & Roses, Michael Jackson and Bob Marley!

I would definitely save up to return again. 9.5/10 rating. This is definitely the best hotel in Trinco. If you are visiting Sri Lanka take it from a local with fairly stringent standards, Trinco blu surpasses expectations. Couldn't find a better hotel for genuine sri lankan warmth and quality refinement in hospitality 👌",Nothing short off TrincoBlu in the East!,2024-07,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r961514278-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

In contrast to every other hotel we visited in Sri Lanka (we had stayed in 6 prior to this hotel) the management at this hotel was absent! The junior suite was very spacious and the beds were comfortable but like the hotel, the room lacked any type of character. The AC unit in the room was it working when we arrived and neither were several of the power sockets.  Once reported, the management promptly sent out an engineer who managed to fix everything. The AC went off again the next night due to a powercut but the back up generator did not kick in for several hours as we were woken up at 5am by the heat! 
The bathroom was rather dated and the towels were not white and fluffy but an off white colour and fraying at the edges (and one had holes).  The pathway to the rooms were also in need of repair with cracked tiles in  several places. 
The pool is a good size but the sunbeds are old and quite rickety.   
Breakfast was ok and buffet style with a mixture of both Sri Lankan and western options.

On arrival the hotel looks OK and the prices would suggest it is of 4 star standard however this is actually not the case. We paid US$158 per night for what we thought was a mini suite room however turned out to be the adjacent room to the executive suite. We were under the impression that the room contained a king size bed however it was a queen and my husband who is 6’1” was too long and his legs hung over the end.

Nothing in the room worked properly. The power pads control numerous lights, fans, etc however some didn’t work and others controlled things they shouldn’t. For example, when you turned off the light above the mirror it also turned off the fan and AC. The second AC unit turned itself off at night and so the bedroom was unbearably hot at night necessitating the fan being switched to high. We advised reception and to their credit they contacted maintenance who came to fix it however it stopped again.

We purchased B&B and breakfast was quite the experience. The poached eggs were precooked and sitting in a Bain Marie which meant they were hard and rubbery. There was carrots vichy, garlic spinach and cooked zucchini together with a multitude of sweets aimed at the children.

The pool area is quite nice however there are insufficient loungers for the number of guests.

The hotel is not on a beach and is about a 10 minute walk from Upavilla Beach. The beach is lovely.

To start with the positives: in general, the outdoor space is nice, and the restaurant and pool staff are really lovely. The chef is also super nice. The breakfast spread is decent. The suite room was large.

The negatives: The fact that there was a bat in our room, and that the manager accused us of making it up / that we let them in by leaving the door open. There was an obvious hole in the roof. Refused to give refund for the night we had to vacate our bat-room at nearly midnight with a 4 month old baby. Offered an insulting 40 USD discount on room extras that we declined. 

A very overpriced stay (370 a night) and the hotel decor and finishings feel cheap & tacky with no hospitality from management. Not worth it at all, and not a luxurious hotel at all.","worst hotel we stayed in in Sri Lanka.

Mayuran was able to recommend tours offered by the hotel . We took the lagoon ride in a canoe and dolphin watching . 
Lagoon ride was fun and different . You get to see some birds and jumping fish . 
And able to enjoy sunset if lucky . Our day was cloudy . But still enjoyed sitting on rocks and  enjoyed the hotel’s complement snack pack . The chocolate cake and rolls were really tasty . Our canoe guide Suji made the ride fun and made sure it was safe .

Even though the hotel was not full on the day we checked-in and requesting for an early check-in about an hour before the normal time, they could not give it on time. Further the AC didn't work. The indoor outdoor  bathroom was good and the bed was good.

Lunch buffet was reasonable but nothing to rave about. Dinner choice was limited. Breakfast choice was the best of the 3 meals. 

The view from the garden was good except that the main electricity supply line on the road is a distraction to the view. 

Since there is a limited choice in hotels close to Polonnaruwa and Minneriya National Park this a hotel one would choose by default rather than choice.

From the outside it looks nice and in a good location, but CLERALY VISIBLE LACK OF MAINTAINENCE has ruined this hotel. Just before we got to the hotel there's some rain, but we did not think anything of it. When we got the room key, we went to the room, and ground floor little living room and toilet/bathroom and the bedroom was upstairs. This wasn't ideal for us because we would have preferred to have an attached toilet. Anyhow, when we checked the bed there was some animal droppings looks like rat dropping were on the bed. We called the reception BUT HAD NO RESPONSE.  

We had to go back to the reception even when it was raining to resolve this issue. Manager-in-charge I believed called Joseph assured us not to worried it is not rat and the will clean the room spot less for us. After hanging round about 30 minutes in the reception we went to the room around 9 pm and I wanted to have a shower therefore, went to the toilet/bathroom area and noticed there was no lights to the bathroom area. My husband used his mobile torch light to see what was there. Bath tub was full covered with black dead animals therefore again had to go to the reception because as usual no one answered the phone...

Second time round not only the manager, I managed to speak to the Group CEO named Mr M I M Nizar and he was trying to convince us that this hotel is in a jungle and NOT in the city of Polonnaruwa!!! According to the Group CEO, as a customer, we should expect animal droppings on the bed as well as dead animals on the floor and the bathroom area including no lights and be able to clean it ourself without making any fuss!!! I mentioned that I am a patient with heart, diabetic and several other illnesses therefore any animal bit could be very dangerous for me. He laughed say that's nothing to worry about!!! 

After so much fuss, we managed to get a temporary light fitted to the bathroom area using a black cable and a very tall dated light should not be recommended to use in a bathroom area at all.  When we looked after they finished this temporary light installation, we could not workout water was coming from the rain though the roof area including the dirt and the dead animals or the shower... We gave up having shower or bath in the end. We tried to used the wash basin in the toilet area and you could see how dirty the mirror was including the rust coming through it and my husband tripped over the cable on the floor and the temporary light switched off. We were far too exhausted by then and went to eat something from the restaurant and they charged us Sri Lankan Rupees 11,500 but hardly anything worth while was there to eat, but being so frustrated and tired we went to the room to sleep.

Next day morning, I took some pictures of the bathroom area roof and the bathtub after cleaned by the hotel staff, temporary light which was fixed to the plug point using two cables without a plug! This Hotel was breaching Electricity; Slips and trips; and HEALTH AND SAFETY Regulation and put our lives at risk. I never come a cross or heard of this kind of behaviour putting customers lives at risk to save few pence or to increase profit. Think not twice, hundred time before you put customers lives at risk like this... I only can say Group CEO and the Manager: Joseph should put themself in customer's (ours) shoes to understand is it worth killing customers for few pence of profit or cost cutting!!! 

Next day, we again mentioned this to the manager (Joseph) and he said he will do something about it. I tried to call Expedia becuase we booked this hotel from them, but not managed to speak to anyone before all my money run out from the mobile. That's worse! When we went to get something to eat before we leave the hotel, I mentioned to my husband it smell like a sewage near our room and when we checked there were some places near the footpath overflowing sewage mixed water outside from the drainages...

This is NOT A FIVE STAR HOTEL and MAY BE EVEN HELL IS BETTER THAN THIS.

I would appreciate if you could get the full refund for our stay including what we had to put up in this hotel.",Hell on earth - NOT A FIVE STAR HOTEL - BREACH HEALTH & SAFETY!!!,2024-03,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304140-d447419-r944661263-Deer_Park_Hotel-Polonnaruwa_North_Central_Province.html

My recent stay was similar.

There's no doubt the hotel looks out onto a beautiful lakeside setting, with a Buddhist wedding on one of the mornings we were there taking advantage of the nature lovers' view.

There were even some frogs croaking around teh hotel, always a good sign as to biodiversity.

Manger Joseph in the buffet restaurant had excellent English and really cared for the guests.  Since my last visit, the area had been expanded.  Food was kept warm to hot, something most like to see in buffets.

The resort has two side-by-side pools.  I did not use.

WiFi only worked outside the bar.

The room was a letdown, as it was loft style, with the bed, a small table and airconditioner up a flight of about 14 concrete stairs.  It was inconvenient at night to have to use stairs to access the toilet.  Anyone who was unsteady on their feet could fall down these concrete stairs.

The shower was roofed but had an outdoorsy feel to it.  Hot water worked well.  Downstairs only had a round table and two chairs, and a rudimentary hanging space with a couple of hangers.  A suitcase shelf was not provided even though what can be a handy feature would have fitted in the room.

Overall because of the loft style, the hotel has to be marked down.  Not all rooms are like this but one elderly lady had to swap rooms to a non-loft syle one.  If the hotel had been full, she would have had unsuitable accommodation.","Good manager and buffet, but loft rooms inconvenient",2024-03,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304140-d447419-r943357284-Deer_Park_Hotel-Polonnaruwa_North_Central_Province.html

We enjoyed a calming Ayurvedic massage in our room, which the hotel kindly arranged through a third party. The manager was also incredibly helpful, organizing a tuk-tuk tour of the ancient city, which allowed us to see many fascinating historical sites. The hotel's location is perfect and right at the heart of these sites 

The food was a nice mix of Asian and Western dishes, all fresh and delicious. The service was exceptional, especially from Arun, who made our stay even more enjoyable. His hospitality was outstanding and his cocktail-making skills are not to be missed! Particularly his Piña Colada! 

The pool and restaurant quickly became our favorite spots to unwind, especially with the wildlife around. I regularly spotted eagles, pelicans, beautiful butterflies, chipmunks and even an occasional toque macaque.

This is probably the best plce to stay Polonnaruwa. It has the elgance of international standards. The staff is exceptionally good. They provided us with kiripidu pojawa for Somawathi temple. We feel the management is not capitalising when marketting the place. Following are some of the points they should consider for marketing:
1. The hotel is situated nearlly on top of Parakrama Samudraya lake giving magnificent views for the rooms. There are no other hotels which provides this in Polonnaruwa.
2. You can watch elephnats bathing. Ideally the hotel should have binoculors for the visitors to watch the beauty of elephant baths. 
3. The hotel seems to have built in 17th or 18th century. Queen Elezebath has stayed in this hotel in 1954 during her Royal visit to Polonnaruwa. You can book this room and use the Roayl batch tub. Unfortaullately I got to know about the room only during my stay, otherwise I would have booked this room.
4. Hotel is almost on the smae premises as King Nissankamalla's palace and parliament built in 12th century. Magnificet ruins are only few feet away.

The restaurant seemed incredibly flexible and caring - I am so grateful to the chef and waiters for introducing me to several fresh and local dishes.

Our previous hotel had to cancel our transport to Echo Lake Hotel because of the previous fuel issues in Sri Lanka. My husband called Echo Lake who immediately stepped up to the plate and organised a van to be with us pdq! 
So that was our first taste of what was to be a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable stay. 

The hotel is rightly proud of it’s high food standards and we were very impressed with requests being accepted and standards surpassing expectations from the chef. Thank you. 

Our room was delightful, a home from home especially charming with signed photograph of the queen who stayed at the hotel during her visit to Sri Lanka in 1954.

The lake itself is the largest manmade lake in the world. As we arrived a fishing eagle swooped down and plucked a fish from the water. The view was pretty fantastic, tranquil and none of the smoke, from regular compost fires in Sri Lanka, made it across to us. It’s a fab place to sit and enjoy under the shade canopy with a light breeze cooling your brow.

If you can tear yourself away from her majesty’s splendid gold bathtub then visit the ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa which are quite literally on the doorstep, well the ticket office is opposite the hotel. 

We felt thoroughly well looked after by Udesh and his team who were able to give us oodles of info on the area and suggestions for easy visiting of the rather large ruined city of Polonnaruwa.  Many other trips can be arranged. We found it hard to leave the calm and comfort, however the hotel offer boat trips on the lake and were willing to organise anything you have a mind to do.

It was a memorable stay. Highly recommend.",Tranquil and Foodie Delight,2023-03,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304140-d6921675-r939457825-Ekho_Lake_House-Polonnaruwa_North_Central_Province.html

Sunsets on the lake are gorgeous - full-stop.

Food and drink options are great, although early breakfast needs pre-warning.

My fave aspect of Ekho Lake House, though, is its location relative to the (stupendous) Polunnaruwa site: it starts literally 20m from the Lake House - well, one grouping within the overall site does.

The location is stunning with a small swimming pool and restaurant overlooking the water. Multiple eagles, water birds and elephants can be seen bathing in the water from the hotel. An amazing sight.

The restaurant needs special mention. We stayed for 3 nights Half Board and every single meal was excellent. Several choices for your main meal (a western style set). Alternatively substitute for a local style curry.

We had a lake view room which was large and very well furnished. The only real let down from the hotel and why I can’t award 5 stars was our room was not cleaned for the entire stay. The first night was a confusion with the door sign to make up the room having fallen off the door and replaced with “do not disturb”. The second night we avoided the sign completely, yet the room still wasn’t cleaned during the day. We reported this to the staff and both nights they were excellent, arranging for the room to be cleaned during dinner.

Our room was comfortable and clean (and included a mosquito net but no products other than soap). All up, this hotel is incredible value.
