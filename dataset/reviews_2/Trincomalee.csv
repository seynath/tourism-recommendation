We looked at the cabana photos and were happy. They looked picture perfect, literally.  We get there and the first thing I observe is that they are NOT beach fronted. We open the door to our cabana and a hit blast hit us! Air conditioning took its time to work. Nothing “deluxe” about it. It’s so compact my husband and I couldn’t pass each other without falling over. The only good thing about the cabana was the bed. It was comfortable. Don’t even want to say anything about the bathroom. I was so glad we did a lot of sight seeing and went to the hotel only for dinner and sleep. 

My friends who opted for rooms told me the rooms were good. I didn’t visit the rooms so cannot say for sure. 

Jimmy and his crew at the restaurant were a different story. Breakfast and dinner were quite good. And the service was fine. Perhaps the only redeeming feature about the hotel. 

Superb view no doubt of the endless sea and we watched two beautiful sunrises, thanks to Mother Nature.

Friendly staff, though several on the Reception appeared to be standing around with little to do.  We had an issue with our AirCon not working, which was a bit of an inconvenience as we had to swop rooms, but the maintenance team did sort it out overtnight. The garden is landscaped around several mature trees and the large pool, which has plenty of loungers, showers and a bar. 
The shower in our room was excellent - good power and heat. Beds hard, but very comfortable. We stayed 4 nights and the room was cleaned daily. Rooms have seating outside.  
Good access to the beach via a private path and several places to have a drink or some food are close by. The nearest, YOUR CHOICE, plays loud music all day so not exactly relaxing if you are using the Anantamaa beach loungers, but at night you can sit nearer the surf on the beach, which softens the noise. The next place down the beach (towards Trincomalee), THE 18th HOLE, had a fun, younger vibe with different stalls offering everything from sushi to burgers, pizza to tacos. Sushi was excellent. A little further down the beach was WAVES restaurant, which did some great fish/seafood, but choice of fish was limited. 
Negatives: The hotel just looks a little tired and really needs updating.  A little more attention to some details and some investment would go a long way. 
Our room was basic - some fitted wardrobes, but only a handful of hangers. No bedside lamp and little decoration on the walls. Felt a bit soulless, but it was clean. 
Breakfast was typical fare, but really  basic and not particularly appetising. Dry pastries and dreadful coffee. 4 days and the same options every day.  It was no big surprise to see that the restaurant was almost empty every night we were there - guests were obviously choosing to dine elsewhere.
The fish ponds surrounding the pool area are green and smelt stagnant - they were so murky, you can only just see the fish swimming in them. Some oxygen and a regular clean is necessary.  The pool area is great, but the bar staff play music for much of the day, the choice of which seems more for their benefit than the guests.  Looking at the guests around the pool (almost entirely elderly and families with young kids) something a little more chilled would have been preferable. The loud beat and tinny sound from the music stopped us relaxing by the pool - otherwise it could have been a tranquil place to relax.  
We were moved to a different room as our AirCon was not working. The replacement room was substandard - the bathroom door was so warped it would not close and the wardrobe door was missing. The shower had weak flow. We asked to be moved back to our original room once the AirCon was fixed, . 
There was also a wedding or party one night we were there, which took place in a function room above guest suites, so we had to endure loud base until 11.30pm. No warning of this, nor any apology when we complained to Reception. 
There is a designated beach area for the sole use of Anantamaa guests, bit it had limited sun loungers and you need to get there early to secure one. There were only four parasols and one was blown away by the wind and removed by staff, never to return.  There had obviously been an effort to clean up all the plastic rubbish from the sand, but it was just left in a big pile next to the loungers, which pretty much summed up the general feel of the hotel.","With some investment and updating, it could be so much better.",2024-08,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7079606-r968149554-Anantamaa-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

They have own restaurant at the hotel . If you have concern about your food my best recommendation is to dine in from their restaurant 
The food was consistently good.Their meals were  prepared with care and extremely high standard.

Their restaurant manager and staff always ready to service you with their best and they always prioritize each and every persons requirements 

Safety is 100%  

I do recommend this hotel any one wished to travel Trinco . I’m so delighted that I have selected this hotel during my staying at Trinco

Rooms were nice and comfortable with great service by the staff. The pool was well located and was well maintained.All in all, a hotel which has the potential to be the leading place of accomadation,but badly let down by the choice of food. We really felt cheated and disappointed when they served just a watery vegetable soup with 4 bowls of salads of mediocre quality and 5 dishes as the mains, where 2 dishes were plain rice and fried rice-out of the 5 dishes.Desert was just ice cream and curd., this too on the 24th of December dinner when guests expected a better spread than this, on Christmas Eve. Even more, we had to stand near the buffet and wait till the dishes were refilled even though they had just 5-6 varieties to refill, but they ran out of food,half way through the evening. The next dinner was even worse with just 2 Salads and just ice cream as the desert. Obviously the management was aware of the situation but they kept passing the ball towards each other instead of making amends.
So if you're planning to stay here, don't expect your moneys worth on meals.

The room was large, the bed was huge and comfortable and the ensuite, while basic, had hot water and a good shower.
It was interesting to watch the local fishermen casting out their huge circular net, then dragging it ashore later in a well practised, very rhythmical routine.

1.	Good Points
a.	This hotel is situated well beside the sea. 5-10Min walk to food restaurants.
b.	The room and toilet were clean.
c.	The staffs were friendly and very accommodating to our requests.
d.	The hotel has a bar overseeing the beach. This was my personal favorite.
e.	The buffet breakfast had decent amount of food variety, mostly Indian food of course, and it was all tasty.

2.	Bad Points
a.	I paid USD200 Per Night (including taxes) for the Superior room. Sadly, the room came with limited view of the beach. My room’s balcony was facing the swimming pool and had many trees, thus blocking my view of the beach.
b.	The hotel does have a swimming pool, but you wouldn’t want to swim in it. There are plenty of stray dogs within the hotel compound, and it pisses in the swimming pool, licks the water from the swimming pool and jumps into the swimming pool, when there's no crowd. 
c.	Black crows are also aplenty within the hotel compound, and licks the water from the swimming pool too.
d.	The beach and sea is just OK, nothing great.

3.	Will I return again to this hotel?
No.",Nice Hotel But Can Be Better,2024-10,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r974409672-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

I booked the hotel online through Cinnamon call center and paid more than half of the reservation amount but when I went to check in they couldn't find my reservation details. So I think they made a new bill. So when I was checking out they gave me a bill without deducting the amount I paid for the reservation online. So I had to show them the Email I received and send a copy of the reservation details to one of the receptionists' WhatsApp to confirm the first payment I made for the booking. It took time and I was waiting with my 2-year-old child to finish this up in the reception area. Then they gave me a new bill with the deducted amount. Then I paid through my card and the amount was deducted from my account but they said that they didn’t receive the amount. It was a just WTF moment for me. I called the bank from my side and they said the amount was deducted from your side and received by the merchant too but the hotel staff refused to accept it. So I have to spend another few hours there with my baby. They came to me and said they hadn’t received the money multiple times but the bank from my side confirmed that they had received the amount. It was not my fault. Finally, the hotel staff has to reverse the payment through the POS system. So that means they have received the amount but I didn’t show up from there said. So It’s completely their fault. The bank also informed me after I got the payment back that my payment had gone through. So the payment reversal is also done by the hotel not by the bank. So it was not the bank or my card’s fault. So I have to spend over 2 hours in the reception. They didn’t even give us a drink while we were waiting. I have gone to so many hotels but this behavior is not acceptable. They should make the guests comfortable. Mistakes can happen they should not make the guest feel uncomfortable. This is my first visit to a cinnamon hotel and the experience is not good.

Given my trust in the Cinnamon Hotels chain and its connection to John Keells Holdings, I was confident it would meet our expectations. We reserved a Superior Ocean View Room, but unfortunately, the experience was far from smooth.

Upon checking in around 5 p.m., the room’s air conditioning wasn’t working. Despite informing the staff immediately, it took several hours to resolve the issue and even longer for them to decide to offer us an alternative room. The substitute room, however, came with its own problems—it was infested with mosquitoes. Although we requested and received a vaporizer, this should have been proactively provided, given the situation.

Additionally, the washrooms were not well-maintained, which further added to the disappointment. For a hotel of this caliber, I expected much better attention to detail and more efficient problem-solving.

Check-in was smooth and we were given lovely cold cinnamon welcome drinks on arrival. We stayed in room 402, which offered both pool and sea views. The direct access to the beach was great and we enjoyed being able to step out onto the beach at anytime. The beach was clean, there were plenty of sunbeds available and the pool/beach staff were very helpful in providing beach towels and sunbed mattresses. We were also able to order drinks that were brought over to us on the beach. We enjoyed lovely sunrise and evening walks along the beach. The breakfast and dinner buffets had a wide variety and we enjoyed our meals during our stay. We also had lunch at The Crab twice and the food and drinks were very good. The staff in both restaurants were friendly and accommodating. 

The hotel needs updating as some parts look tired and worn out, including the mirrors behind the reception desks, this is important for first impressions. Although there is a light natural breeze at the entrance, ceiling fans would help keep the area and guests cooler when checking-in and out. Housekeeping is offered twice daily, which is helpful given the mess that can come into your room following an afternoon at the beach. We personally wouldn't have minded if the room had a broom, so we could sweep up sand etc. after ourselves rather than wait for housekeeping later in the day. A mat or towel by the beach entrance door would also be good to wipe your feet after rinsing off before stepping into your room. The ceiling shower and toiletries were good, we felt it would have been useful to also have a handheld shower to rinse off the shower area once finished. The bins in the room and bathroom were rusty and could easily be replaced. We found the live music at dinner to be a little loud and not to everyone's taste. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful when needed. We will definitely return to Trinco Blu and would recommend to family and friends.",Lovely stay at Trinco Blu,2024-09,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r971131752-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

Trinco Blu’s approach might disguise you but as you enter you know you have reached the most lovable location for your vacation. I have decided to review on different parameters from now on, here it is:
Reception &checkin- A smiling and warm reception, cold and sweet passion fruit welcome drink, checkin smooth. Rated 5 on a scale of 1-5
Room- small compact room, little crowded, first floor, sea facing, quite airy, very effective Aircon, Tea coffee maker with sachets. Sitting are outside the room with two chairs, small table, and a lying down cushion. Rated 4.5
Bathroom- a large bathroom and an open air shower. Basics provided in the bathroom (bottled shampoo, shower gel and body lotion) , warm tab provides lukewarm water only. Rated-4
Food- Breakfast was better than dinner. Though they have a separate restaurant for seafood may be that is the reason the seafood was just for namesake in the buffet dinner. Everything was tasty and displayed professionally. Rated - 4.5
Bar- non air conditioning area with fans, open to the lawns, carry your drink anywhere. We tried a special Sri Lankan liqueur branded Narikela, we both fell in love with the drink and later bought one from the market for the rest of the trip. Rated- 5
Hospitality and Service- A very polite and service oriented staff. A special mention of Pratheep and Ursula at the reception. Rated- 5
Overall rating- overall I will rate Trincomalee Blu at 4.7 out of five. 
Suggestions for travellers: Dolphin watching is fun especially when you are with kids but don’t fall for the random guy who reaches you on the sea shore and offers cheap price. Always reach out to the hotel and book from them, though expensive but suggested for safety and other reasons.","Lovely location, sea lover’s paradise",2024-08,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r967278960-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

As non expatriate locals living in Sri Lanka the half board price was pretty steep for us. But we indulged and splurged as the place looked amazing. As did the ocean

TRINCO BLU didnt fail to disappoint 
Firstly the superior room was very well maintained, clean and had a great view and ambience similar to the hotel. Very relaxed vibes. Pool was well equipped with showers, towels and constantly kept clean. Beach was similarly upkept with no touts and pristine white sand. Blessed with an ocean of dreams. I've never seen a sea more blue where you could wade out to calm waters for miles. 

Buffet of dinner and breakfast were top class. 10/10 Cinnamon! Me being a foodie i have to say the variety was unmatchable. we had delicious crab, squid, fish and a variety of meat preparations. International buffet with Indian western and fabulous traditional Eastern province local preparations. Breakfast on a Thursday had freshly made hoppers pol rotti and even a fabulous ""Diya Buth"". Apart from the traditional English breakfast specials there was an area traditional sweet milk rice as well. Very large and lavish spread!

Last but not least staff hospitality was excellent. From reception to dining staff everyone was courteous and accommodative. We checked out on Friday at 12pm and hung around for our train till 7pm. We were even given a proper room space for the ten min of prayers we required without shoving us into an odd corner. This I thought was next level. In a hotel at capacity bookings with foreign guests the care shown to the few locals was truly commendable. Much respect and love.

It must be mentioned the Live music singer was one of the best iv heard, singing local songs and a vocal range covering Guns & Roses, Michael Jackson and Bob Marley!

I would definitely save up to return again. 9.5/10 rating. This is definitely the best hotel in Trinco. If you are visiting Sri Lanka take it from a local with fairly stringent standards, Trinco blu surpasses expectations. Couldn't find a better hotel for genuine sri lankan warmth and quality refinement in hospitality 👌",Nothing short off TrincoBlu in the East!,2024-07,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r961514278-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

In contrast to every other hotel we visited in Sri Lanka (we had stayed in 6 prior to this hotel) the management at this hotel was absent! The junior suite was very spacious and the beds were comfortable but like the hotel, the room lacked any type of character. The AC unit in the room was it working when we arrived and neither were several of the power sockets.  Once reported, the management promptly sent out an engineer who managed to fix everything. The AC went off again the next night due to a powercut but the back up generator did not kick in for several hours as we were woken up at 5am by the heat! 
The bathroom was rather dated and the towels were not white and fluffy but an off white colour and fraying at the edges (and one had holes).  The pathway to the rooms were also in need of repair with cracked tiles in  several places. 
The pool is a good size but the sunbeds are old and quite rickety.   
Breakfast was ok and buffet style with a mixture of both Sri Lankan and western options. Lunch and dinner however were al la carte and they were both very good, serving some of the best food we had during our stay in Sri Lanka.

On arrival the hotel looks OK and the prices would suggest it is of 4 star standard however this is actually not the case. We paid US$158 per night for what we thought was a mini suite room however turned out to be the adjacent room to the executive suite. We were under the impression that the room contained a king size bed however it was a queen and my husband who is 6’1” was too long and his legs hung over the end.

Nothing in the room worked properly. The power pads control numerous lights, fans, etc however some didn’t work and others controlled things they shouldn’t. For example, when you turned off the light above the mirror it also turned off the fan and AC. The second AC unit turned itself off at night and so the bedroom was unbearably hot at night necessitating the fan being switched to high. We advised reception and to their credit they contacted maintenance who came to fix it however it stopped again.

We purchased B&B and breakfast was quite the experience. The poached eggs were precooked and sitting in a Bain Marie which meant they were hard and rubbery. There was carrots vichy, garlic spinach and cooked zucchini together with a multitude of sweets aimed at the children.

The pool area is quite nice however there are insufficient loungers for the number of guests.

The hotel is not on a beach and is about a 10 minute walk from Upavilla Beach. The beach is lovely. 

The problem is there are only two high end hotels so there is no competition.",Sri Lankan Fawlty Towers,2024-08,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r965380006-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html

Very over-priced for what it is, terrible management & not good for young children! 

To start with the positives: in general, the outdoor space is nice, and the restaurant and pool staff are really lovely. The chef is also super nice. The breakfast spread is decent. The suite room was large.

The negatives: The fact that there was a bat in our room, and that the manager accused us of making it up / that we let them in by leaving the door open. There was an obvious hole in the roof. Refused to give refund for the night we had to vacate our bat-room at nearly midnight with a 4 month old baby. Offered an insulting 40 USD discount on room extras that we declined. 

A very overpriced stay (370 a night) and the hotel decor and finishings feel cheap & tacky with no hospitality from management. Not worth it at all, and not a luxurious hotel at all.","worst hotel we stayed in in Sri Lanka.

Hotel rooms are very spacious with a large jacuzzi . We had a king bed and a roller bed and still lots of room to move around .
Bathrooms were clean and spacious . 
Mayuran was able to recommend tours offered by the hotel . We took the lagoon ride in a canoe and dolphin watching . 
Lagoon ride was fun and different . You get to see some birds and jumping fish . 
And able to enjoy sunset if lucky . Our day was cloudy . But still enjoyed sitting on rocks and  enjoyed the hotel’s complement snack pack . The chocolate cake and rolls were really tasty . Our canoe guide Suji made the ride fun and made sure it was safe .
