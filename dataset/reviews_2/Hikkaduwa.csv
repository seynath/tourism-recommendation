We booked Hikkatranz as a base and also went travelling around Sri Lanka. 

Firstly, Sri Lanka is a beautiful place. 

First impressions of a few members of staff (a main lady) on the entrance of the restaurant were not great. She was not too welcoming, very dismissive and rude. 

However, as we settled into our trip we enjoyed ourselves. The food was tasty and never repetitive. There was everything from authentic Sri Lanka food, to Russian, English, Asian etc cuisine.  

The grounds are beautiful and well maintained and the rooms are large. Special mention to Dinash, he was our room cleaner. He went the extra mile daily and made us feel welcome during our stay with his daily conversations and smiley face. 

One thing that marred our experience a tiny bit were the big organised groups of men that would embark upon the hotel and fully take over the place, getting drunk, loud and lairy. 

Also, the turtles that swam to the shore line of the beach added to the magic of this holiday. 

All in all, good and I’d highly recommend this hotel.",Dinash was a superstar,2024-08,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d579245-r976485624-Hikka_Tranz_by_Cinnamon-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Big shout out to Manoj from room  cleaning. His sense of humour and skill in towel origami is only outdone by his professional service.

They are supported by all the other Chefs, Cook's, Waiting staff, Kitchen staff, Indoor & Outdoor Bar staff, Security personnel, grounds keepers, and Admin staff. Hoppers are best in Sri Lanka cooked by a very lovely lady.
Rooms are well appointed with good cooling and bathroom facilities. Beds are big and made up every day as well as fresh towels and the room cleaned.
Pool area is beautiful with plenty of towels that can be used at the beach as well. 
The resort is located in a fantastic spot on the corner of the coast with a great swimming beach and another section where turtles come in to eat seaweed. 
A really great place for couples or families to relax at any stage of a Sri Lankan holiday.

We had a beautiful room with sea view, the pool was fantastic, the food was the best we've eaten in Sri Lanka, but what made it for us were the staff here were just outstanding. Each and every member of the team worked so hard to make their guests happy. They greeted us with smiles, were helpful and so very friendly. The manager Warna is wonderful, couldn't do enough and we loved our chats with him. Sugath's smiles around the pool, attentive at every moment to us and kind to our daughter, getting drinks, towels and balls for the pool (he even cleaned our tuk tuk rental for us!) Sampath was courteous at meal times, explaining the different dishes and Kalani made us welcome from the start as did all the staff here who helped with our bags and kept our room wonderfully clean, I wish I could name each individually as they all deserve a mention! 

We ate at the hotel as the chef took the time to talk with the guests and he put my mind at rest that he would serve Sri Lankan food that wasn't too spicy for us. The food was wonderful! It was a pleasure to stay and eat here. 
Overall, with only 6 rooms the hotel feels peaceful, it's quiet around the pool and beach, but it's not too far from the main town for the restaurants and shops. Pool is perfect with shady spots during the heat of the day, plenty of sun loungers and right on the beautiful beach. Rooms were bright and spacious with great air con comfy beds and a huge bathroom and balcony. We couldn't have wanted for more. 

Thanks to all of you for making the last 3 nights of our holiday very memorable!

The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to be on a quieter side of Hikkaduwa, slightly away from the crowds but only a short walk from the bars/ restaurants and shops. It feels very private. 

The decor is beautiful throughout the hotel with gorgeous furnishings, all creating a very cosy, relaxing vibe. The rooms are spacious and bright with an amazing-sized balcony, all with an outstanding sea view. 

The beds are super comfortable and all the room amenities make it feel extra special. The hotel has a high level of cleanliness throughout and the housekeeping staff do an excellent job in the rooms. Attention to detail is superb in all areas. 

 The pool is very well maintained and provided lots of fun for my baby boy. The pool staff, especially Sugath do an excellent job. My baby is still asking for him. His kindness will not be forgotten. Every staff member went above and beyond to make our stay feel extra special. Warune the manager was very attentive, he would go out of his way every day to make sure my family was comfortable. Supan the chef is very talented at what he does. We ate the best food we have ever tasted in Sri Lanka. We recommend the Sri Lankan Curry as it’s absolutely delicious! The restaurant staff were all excellent and again my baby will miss Bhagya, Udshion and Akalanka. Kelanee on reception is very polite and caring. Christi is also a lovely man, we can’t thank him enough for his kindness. The hotel really does have a nice atmosphere and I believe the staff are to thank for this.

Well done Mercury I’m impressed.

The maid was the best. Everyday the room was spotless and he  made little bed decorations, towels  were changed everyday,  excellent job. 

The waiters and bar staff are good and the food was satisfactory. 

I loved the pool Aqua and found it was a very good workout. 

The two pool attenders gave a 7 star service in all the hotels I have ever stayed this was the best. The moment I arrived at the pool a sun bed was selected and the towel laid out for me. The two pools guys deserve a pay rise.

We used the Spa and can highly recommend it. Really good massage. 

Roger, did karaoke/ DJ  evenings we really enjoyed, everyone  got involved on these nights , they were great fun.
 Loved the live music in the evening,

The public areas were lovely and nothing too much trouble for the staff. We were bed and breakfast and there was always plenty to eat and variety we did have some lunches from the bar too.  We both had treatments from the spa and for hotel prices it was very good and the lady was lovely.  Hotel is well placed but preferred going right out of hotel to restaurants and bars. There is a supermarket opp where some people brought bottles of drink and left them and rubbish around the pool are and were demanding of the staff. (there is a war goin on in there country) Seeing the turtles in the shallow water was really nice but go early as later on lots of pushing and shoving on who’s getting the closest or the best picture. We took a tuktuk from outside the hotel turtle hatchery Urawatteseaturtle on galle road and we let go of some tiny little hatchlings we gave a donation to do this. We booked our main trip with our holiday company as we had heard you could be stuck with east euros who are loud abusive if we had booked outside, as they can cram you in so there was only 4 x of us and our drivers were good drivers and very knowledgable the trip was to Udawalawe national park. It was raining but that didn’t matter as we all thought it was fantastic a great day early start though but to go thru the towns and just see people were goin about there day we did have enough time on way back to go to Galle fort and have a quick walk round we even saw the man who dives into the water from the fort.

The food wasn’t great but our “terrible” review comes from our mistreatment. The service was dreadful, taking over and hour to receive a brownie (which was very similar to a supermarket brownie in the UK), my friend didn’t receive cutlery before her food (a bolognese) was cold (despite many requests) and the mojitos were essentially minty water. We had a very slow waiter who seemed to be unsure of his job and asked us many times what our order was despite writing it down the first time. On completing our food, we simply requested to not pay the service charge or have a slight discount as the service was so poor. The waiter then asked another waiter who, upon hearing our complaint, said it wasn’t his fault as it was busy (the restaurant was not near full) and we should go elsewhere next time if we were so unhappy. Obviously, we then asked for a manager. After telling him the story and saying what this waiter had just said he called the waiter over and asked if this was true, he said not and the manager accused us of lying. He also stated that we couldn’t have any money off as we had consumed the food and not made any complaints. When rebutting the fact we had not complained he stated that due to US not asking for the manager earlier, the whole situation was our fault. We argued this was clearly not good hospitality he became more aggressive and frustrated with us. He then went away and sent over a female employee who upon asking turned out to be an assistant, likely sent over to pacify us with a female approach - we simply asked for the manager back. Eventually, he shouted that if we wanted money off it would come from the waiters salary, which we said would be his choice and that we were happy to take the discount - especially having been there so long and it now being quite a scene. We then waited for a card reader to pay but instead a group of several male workers arrived with an older male at the center claiming to be the manager himself. He acted in a very aggressive and demeaning manner, making us feel quite unsafe and said that we couldn’t have the discount promised just minutes earlier. We did then complain to him but began to feel as though we were being threatened with an ultimatum and he gave the impression he would be ready to hit us. For our safety we then paid and left, feeling as though had we not do so things could have been very bad. Most frustratingly we all felt had we had a male friend with us we may have not been treated with such disrespect and lack of dignity. This ruined one of my friends’ last nights in Sri Lanka!

There is very few hotels in the world that try so hard to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The hotel has many shops and bars close by with no hard sale from staff. The area around has every thing needed. The town Hikkaduwa is not massive and not silly busy. great shops .lovely stretches of beach and lovely friendly locals always wanting to chat. People have complained about the gap year students coming to the hotel . They are great kids, doing brilliant unpaid help in Sri Lanka and they deserve a few hours fun on there afternoons of They never caused any problems and actually made the hotel buzz . The people complaining in my opinion are out of order having fun is not a crime. Please do not stop coming to this beautiful hotel because of a few people who want hotels to be like libraries. We have promised the staff that we will be back to stay again and we will definitely keep our promise. Try it for your selves and hope you have a wonderful stay like our 3 weeks.

Since it was a Saturday, a local holiday, the hotel was bustling with guests, both local and foreign. This large crowd might have overwhelmed the staff, as the restaurant was constantly packed, making it difficult to even get a glass of water.
Despite the crowded atmosphere, the room itself was comfortable and cozy, albeit lacking an elevator, which could be a concern for some guests. The staff, however, were friendly and helpful.
One unsettling aspect of the stay was the presence of stray cats wandering around the restaurant area, seemingly ignored by the staff. Additionally, a crow managed to enter the restaurant and snatch food from a plate. These hygiene concerns detracted from the overall experience.
While the hotel's location and room comfort were positive aspects, the overcrowded atmosphere, limited service, and hygiene issues require improvement.

Even though we reached the hotel late after travelling the entire day from Ella but the smiles on the front office staff put all our tiredness to rest. Check-in was breeze - Thanks to ever-smiling Naomi at the reception - gave us 3 adjoining rooms with amazing sea view. 

Loved the pool. The Pool time is 7:30 to 7:30 however must thank the staff who, upon enquiring, was willing to open the pool even after 7:30pm - very accommodating staff. 

Though the entrance t o the room is facing the road but once you are inside the room - the sea view is mesmerizing.

The Resturant and the bar on the beach has good vibes and the staff is really helpful., they suggested some local brew and I was surprised how good they tasted.

For the breakfast - The Resturant has limited options, apart from Sri Lankan breakfast. I would be nice if they can add a few dishes to the breakfast.

It is very rare that I have to log a full complaint about the standard of a hotel. We are very accepting of most things and tolerate a lot.

However, with regret we feel we have no choice but to take this matter further. 

Before I go on, both the hotel and Mercury Holidays are fully aware of our problems and despite being asked to sort them on numerous occasions, they have done NOTHING to help, even when I gave them a very cheap solution.  

Mold in the shower
Mould in the bathroom
Mould around the aircon, very dangerous
General Mould in other areas of the hotel
Cracked tiles around the pool
Dirty pool towels
Plaster/render coming off walls
And so it goes on.

The hotel also allows non paying guests, mainly gap year students, to come into the hotel and use the sunbeds and facilities. The theory is they buy food and drink in return, but they don't. They just make it almost impossible for paying guests to get sunbeds. We also have to put up with screeching and giggling constantly. As one guest said, it's like we are part of a university campus. Even the students say they can't believe they can use the facilities for free.

But that all pails into insignificance when it comes to Wednesday and Thursday night. A night billed as Karaoke entertainment for the hotel guests. But that's not the case. Wednesday and Thursday nights are when over 100 of the students descend on the hotel. They get drunk, jump in the pool in their underwear (mainly girls), and then run through the hotel, making the floors wet and generally causing mayhem. Point to note: The pool closes at 19.00hrs for paying guests, but has no time limit for non paying guests

As for the actual karaoke, this gets totally taken over by the students. The noise is so loud from their shouting that you can't use the restaurant. They also take over the bar so we can't get a drink. Point to note: The bar closes at 23.00hrs for paying guests, but 23.30 or later for non paying guests

Some nights, the management think that the best solution is to move paying guests and put them in a conference room for dinner so that the students can still enjoy themselves. The conference room is basically a box with no windows.

A point to note, there is only one bar and one restaurant at the hotel and they are attached to each other and with lovely sea views. The conference room is a box with no windows and one door.

The complaints the hotel have received are constant and plentiful. The management and guest relations openly admit that all nationalities are complaining. But they do nothing to help the paying guests. I have spoken to the management right up to the main general manager. Whilst they sympathise, they say they can't do anything because they need the extra money.

The hotel has a 5 star sister hotel. I suggested they could move paying guests there for the remainder of the holiday. The Mercury rep and Mercury head office said we could move, but only if we paid the difference. With other tour operators they would sort it, and pay the difference if needs be. Not tell the client to sort it

I complained again to both the rep and Mercury. And again we asked to be moved. But the response was the same, you can ask the hotel if they will move you, but there's nothing we can do!!!  REALLY!!! I pointed out to Mercury that our contract is with them and as such it is they who need to sort our problems.

On the penultimate night, they implemented what I had repeatedly suggested and moved the Karaoke to the conference room. However, this has a flipside. It now means hotel guests have no evening entertainment for 2 nights a week whilst the hotel entertains the students and neglects it's guests. Basically the non paying students are more important than it's paying guests

Honestly this whole experience has been quite possibly the worst ever. We have NEVER stayed in a hotel that puts non paying people, before their paying guests. On a positive, the staff, food and drink are all fantastic. It's a shame they are let down by management that are more interested in running a cabaret bar than a hotel

Check in was swift and we were given a room with lovely views on top floor. The room had a large balcony with views of beach and pool. 

Room was quite spacious with flat screen TV with many satellite channels. There was a fridge, kettle, safe deposit box and plenty of storage. Bathroom had a walk in shower. It was small but adequate. 

Food in dining room was generally good but limited vegetarian choices were on offer on some days. However the chef was happy to prepare other vegetarian dishes which I did order on a couple of days.

There was only 1 bar by the restaurant and they had a range of local beers, wines, spirits and cocktails on offer for all inclusive guests. I would have preferred another bar near the reception area. Also there was limted seating near reception area. Would have liked more indoor seating areas which would be useful on rainy days. 

However the beach was nice and turtle beach was only 5 minutes walk away where we got to see turtles on a couple of days. Also one could swim at turtle beach. Swimming was not allowed on beach opposite hotel when we were there due to rough seas.

Pool was small but adequate. It was constantly kept clean by pool attendant who was friendly. The team at reception was very friendly too and looked after all our needs.

Outside the hotel, there were plenty of shops, bars and restaurants. There is also a supermarket directly opposite the hotel.

Evening entertainment was generally low key but pleasant. However on one evening they had a DJ who played bollywood/Sri Lankan music and everyone danced away despite the heavy rain outside. 

We would be happy to visit this hotel perhaps in the drier season.

The children had a fantastic time playing in the sea, soaking up the sun, and building sandcastles.

The food, cocktails, and service were all excellent. A big thank you to the chef and his team (Nimal, Thilina, Nandana, Nuwan, Sampath, Chinthaka, Gerad, Kaushalya, & Sathsarani).

We have to give a huge shout out to the hotel driver who picked us up and dropped us off at Colombo Airport - as well as taking us out for a day to Yala National Park where we had the good fortune to not only see elephants and mugger crocodiles but also a leopard.

Breakfast was excellent and both restaurants have good food and varied menus.  This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and the hotel was well placed to not only relax but to also see some of the country, the Old Fort in Galle being another great visit.

From the moment we arrived, we received a warm welcome from the staff. The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel was calm and peaceful. One of the best parts of our stay was the hotel's beachfront location, providing us with stunning views and easy access to the beach.

The food was absolutely delicious. In fact, our return trip was largely motivated by the warm hospitality and fantastic cuisine. Everyone in our group enjoyed the meals, especially the biriyani, which was incredibly flavorful and generously filled with chicken pieces and cashews. We were even able to thank the chef personally for making the best biriyani we've ever had.

Special mention goes to the waitress, Benisha. She remembered us from our previous visit and was extremely helpful, always suggesting the best dishes for us to try and doing so with a big smile. She made our dining experience even more enjoyable. Additionally, since my mother is a vegetarian, Benisha provided her with a full board menu featuring a variety of vegetarian dishes, which was very thoughtful and appreciated.

Thank you so much, Riff Hikkaduwa, for making our stay memorable.

The hotel manager Raymond was  great and made sure any small problems we had were quickly ironed out.
The food from both restaurants were delicious and again the service from all the staff was 5 star. We stayed in the Marriott in Weligama and this hotel is way better than the Marriott.

The first time when me and my husband went to Riff, I was served raw chicken. They first said it’ll take 10 minutes to re-do the dish, and after the 10 minutes had passed, they suddenly said it’ll take another 15 minutes. We had only planned an hour for our lunch, so we had to leave and I had to be hungry for the rest of the day.

We tried our luck again, the second time we went to the Japanese rooftop restaurant. When we first went up, we were seated at the bar “while they fix a table for us”. We sat there for 10 minutes, without seeing any progress with our table, while there were at least 2 empty tables where we could’ve easily been seated to. Also there were groups of people coming in who got a table and service before us, even though we were there first.

When we finally got seated and served the food, it was very good. “Worth the wait,” we thought. In reality, we were hit again with a long waiting time for dessert which took them 50 minutes to bring out. The servers had little to none attention to us, we had to be the ones who made ourselves seen. 

Safe to say I’m incredibly dissapointed. I had super high hopes for this hotel as it looks absolutely stunning, but we gave it a chance twice, and it failed us both times.",May be a beautiful hotel but not a great dining experience,2024-04,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r946432659-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We arrived at 8am off our flight and they offered us a complimentary breakfast when we arrived. You could not fault the hotel staff in any way, they were always so helpful and friendly. They allowed us to use the reception phone when our flight was cancelled which was very kind.

Our room was beautiful and always replenished with towels, toiletries and well cleaned every day. The pool area was amazing, super clean and well maintained. Special thanks to the man at the pool (not sure of his name) who we made great friends with over the 5 days and always accommodated us with beds before we even asked.

We ate in all of the restaurants and the food was of very high standard, not a bad meal once. The homemade granola qt breakfast was particularly delicious! We booked the Romantic Getaway, had a bottle of wine on arrival, a gorgeous 5 course meal at the pool and an excellent 30 minute couples massage.

If you are looking for the perfect get away to enjoy the beautiful Sri Lankan coastline, then make sure to book in at Riff Hikkaduwa. 

The bright and airy lobby welcomes you to the hotel, with views of the infinity pool and ocean greeting you as you arrive. A nice fresh fruit juice was given to us as we checked in, before being shown to our rooms. 

The focus on sustainability and natural feel is evident throughout the hotel. With lots of natural light and soothing decor. The rooms are large and spacious and well stocked with all the amenities that you require. Laundry prices are very reasonable and our room attendants did a fantastic job at keeping our room clean and tidy during the stay.

Throughout the stay we were welcomed by the amazing staff, Bashiyna was one of the ladies who was our waitress throughout and her beautiful smile and warm personality made our breakfasts, lunches or dinner a delight. 
The menu offers a selection of Western and local dishes giving plenty of options to try. The Japanese restaurant on the roof top provides high quality dishes for all tastes!

The staff on reception were very help in arranging a few tours for us, one to Galle and one to Udawalawe National Park. Both drivers were very kind and a wealth of information about what we were seeing and explaining local traditions and cultures to us. They also arranged our return journey to the airport in Colombo. 

The hotel is on the beach, meaning that you can easily go for walks down the beach to surf or visit Turtle Beach. 

As we were statying over New Year, we were lucky to be part of the NYE celebrations at the hotel. The hotel provided an amazing evening, with a extensive buffet, drinks, music and traditional dances. All the staff worked so hard to pull off the evening, and we are grateful for their efforts. 

Every member of staff, from the owner, general manager, waiters/ waitresses etc were incredibly friendly and welcoming. We left feeling like friends! 

The hotel had a mixture of families and couples staying, making it the perfect get away for everyone. We left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated, 
We will definitely be returning to this incredible hotel

We stayed in the spacious Vayu Pool Villa, which was well-maintained and provided a tranquil retreat with a pristine private pool. The villa’s layout offered comfort, luxury, and privacy—ideal for a relaxing holiday.

Breakfasts at the resort began with a fresh fruit platter featuring a delightful selection of local fruits, a wonderful start to each day. The Sri Lankan breakfast with flavorful beef and fish curries was a standout, showcasing authentic local cuisine. For lunch, our parents enjoyed a delicious serving of fish and chips, while the southern-style fish in banana wrap was splendidly prepared and packed with flavor.

Dinner arrangements were memorable, with the first night set up on the beach for our family of six, including our parents. The beachside ambiance paired with a delicious meal made it an evening to remember. On the second night, our dinner in the garden, surrounded by candlelight under a starry sky, was truly magical. The fish was perfectly prepared, and our eight-year-old son loved the fish and chips so much he wanted it again!

To end the meals on a sweet note, we indulged in the chocolate chip sundae for dessert, which was absolutely fabulous and worth every bite.

The serene beachfront, attentive hospitality, and Aditya’s overall ambiance make it an idyllic holiday getaway. From the front desk to the restaurant team, the staff’s genuine warmth and dedication made us feel truly at home.

From the time I chose Aditya and made a reservation I was given the maximum support by the General manager Mr. Shamindra Fernando and the resident manager Mr. Susil. Every aspect of the arrangement were discussed and arranged to my absolute satisfaction. 

On arrival we were garlanded with fragrant frangipane flowers and served delicious fresh passion juice….there followed a wonderful tea service in the garden… we then chillaxed near the bar and the pool and thereafter dressed up for evening cocktails with delicious canapés and a super al fresco 4 course dinner under the stars. 

The staff, the service, the ambience, the decor,  the quality of the meals were amazing. 

On returning to my suite my room had been decorated to resemble a fairyland of candles with a wonderful banner wishing me a fabulous birthday. I have never been this spoilt and was truly touched by the care taken to make this day so special for me. 

Thank you Aditya for  making my dream of an amazing birthday come to life.

This was to be our final stop on a 10 day adventure travelling round the country, so we were looking forward to total relaxation.

We stayed in the beautiful Aditi Villa - a stunning villa with a huge outside area complete with private pool and shaded terrace with a gently swinging day bed. Our own private lawn where we watched the local mongoose family tootle across each day, lead directly onto the beach.

It was really bad timing that I had started to develop a dental infection, which stopped me in my tracks not long after we arrived! But to be honest, this is when you really see the true heart of a place and it's people. 
I was gutted to cancel our anniversary dinner, especially when we saw the efforts the team had gone to for us. (sparkly light, flowers...!) Not long after, there was a knock on the door and in came a concerned member of the restaurant team with a cup of ginger tea to make me feel better. They genuinely wanted to make sure I was OK.
I managed to get sorted with meds the next morning, and was able to enjoy the rest of my stay. 
The care, warmth and compassion I felt throughout our stay made me feel so relaxed and incredibly fortunate. The team really treat you like a returning friend. We felt so spoiled and genuinely cared for.

I would recommend Aditya to any client - couples or families  - anyone who would enjoy wonderful service and  food in relaxed boutique-style surroundings on a wonderfully rugged part of the Sri Lankan coastline.

Our only criticism of this location was that we are firmly of the opinion that the Aditya should definitely be an Adult only resort. The peace and quiet was completely uninterrupted until families arrived with young children and things changed significantly. There is only one pool with no facility to cater for children and this resulted in huge amounts of noise.

Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are so friendly and accomodating. The food is delicious and the breakfast selection perfect.

They even have a super friendly onsite dog and although there are a few stray dogs around (typical for this part of Sri Lanka) even they are super friendly and delightful company! We wish we could have brought one in particular home with us, he was such a gentle natured boy.

Just finished a whistle stop tour of Sri Lanka.  9 hotels in 14 days ranging from small boutiques to large complexes and this was arguably my favorite of the lot!

We stayed in the Pool room which as the name suggests had access to both the pool and the beach. Plenty of room for 2 teens and 2 adults and very tastefully furnished.

A wonderful Sri Lankan breakfast (easily the best breakfast of my trip). Nice bar area and pool also which the kids enjoyed.

Nothing is too much trouble for them, they are both friendly, helpful and hard working, always on hand to help with any little thing, even if it is just local travel advice. The deputy manager Kumarasiri was especially friendly and made sure our every need was met.
The room was huge an easily accomodated the four of us, we had the pool suite which opened on both sides, to the pool and also the beachfront garden, where you can dine, use the sunbeds or just relax on a sofa and read, that's if you don't want to sit on your large balcony.
The beds were very comfortable and the 4-poster in the main room was huge. everything was provided in the bathroom, loads of towels, shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel.
The restaurant and dining were fabulous, breakfast has a range of options from traditional Sri Lankan breakfast with sambal and rice to continential or cooked, loads of fresh fruit and juice, and of course tea, it wouldn't be Sri Lanka without Ceylon tea. Evening meals were fabulous, we ate there most nights, very reasonable pricing for such tasty and feshly cooked food, i particularly enjoyed the black pork curry and my kids loved the fried noodles and fried rice.
Our kids loved the pool area, it's secluded and sheltered, right next to the rooms and the pool bar.
The hotel itself is secured at night and has a permanent security guard once the staff go home, the guard is a lovely fellow, constantly patrolling and keeping an eye out which is very reassurring. 
One day we had to leave to go to the temple at a very early hour of 5am, so the hotel prepared us packed breakfasts (which they didn't have to do) and the security guard made sure we had them ready for when we left.
I cannot reccomend this place more highly, out of the 5 places we stayed in Sri Lanka, from east to west coast, this was the highlight and the best accomodation experience, it way exceeeded my expectations, especially given the very cheap price, i would not have expected somewhere so good at such a low price per night for 4 people.",An amazing colonial-style boutique hotel with fabulous staff and facilities,2024-08,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r965954499-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This little hotel is directly on the beach. We were lucky to have the room called Polonnaruwa on the first floor which has amazing views over the private garden and outdoor dining area to the smooth sandy beach and turquoise sea. The room was extremely spacious with a huge four-poster bed and colonial style furniture. In fact I would say that out of all the hotels we have stayed in, this was the most sumptuous. The room also had a huge private balcony with a massive and comfortable day bed. Ideal to enjoy watching the sun-setting with cold glass of Lion Lager or a gin and tonic from the bar. Breakfasts are amazing and we had the choice of a Sr Lankan breakfast , English Breakfast or Continental Breakfast. I can recommend both the English and Sri Lankan- freshly cooked and delicious. We also ate in the evening twice and thoroughly enjoyed the food which is always freshly prepared which means you might have to wait a little. 
You could tell that all the well trained staff enjoyed working at Suite Lanka- always smiling and happy to help with anything. The outside dining area looks onto the beach and there are a few comfortable sun-beds in the garden facing the sea and a few on the beach itself with parasols providing shade. We had a throughly relaxing stay at Suite Lanka and whilst it is at the quieter end of the beach- the noisier beach bars and restaurants are only  10 minute stroll on the beach. The hotel does have a small courtyard pool which we didn’t use as we spent our time on the sunbeds or paddling in the crashing waves.

Our room was fab - large and airy, comfortably furnished, with the perfect view across the beach to the sea from the huge private balcony.

The pool is lovely and the lounges comfortable,

Security is excellent and the place is quiet. 

Breakfast is always generous with the best fresh fruit, fresh juice, eggs and toast - and always a lovely sweet surprise to follow. Coconut pancakes are a favorite!

I would like to note the excellent combination of price and quality of this property!

The room has a good, fresh renovation, everything is quite modern, there are bathrobes, all the accessories for a comfortable stay (shower gel, shampoo, some other little things). Excellent breakfasts, every day we were served fruit (watermelon, bananas, mango, papaya), smoothies, coffee with milk, scrambled eggs with sausages, toast, and they were constantly supplemented with something new. It’s impossible to eat everything)) The villa’s grounds are very well maintained, a nice swimming pool, a very attentive owner who was ready to resolve any issue as quickly as possible. It felt like we were visiting good friends. Location: The villa is a five-minute walk from the main road, which runs parallel to the coast. There are different cafes nearby, we usually chose Google Maps based on reviews and went to different places. For those who are planning an independent trip around the island, the location is also very convenient, as the bus station and railway station are within walking distance.

The beach is within a short walk down the road. There are a few nice bars towards the railway line and a nice breakfast/lunch outlet on the corner. 

Beautiful apartments and work was continuing to improve them although we don’t think this was needed. 

Chamara was contactable throughout our stay and was available to answer any questions we had. 

It was my birthday whilst we stayed and everyone wished happy birthday, and given flowers and a small cake. Perfect little touches! 

On our last morning Chamara also took us to our next destination. I believe he also does tours of booked in advance.

Sunil took time to get to know us and our personal preferences which meant that he gave a high level of personal service that you don’t get in other properties. The rest of the team also made sure that everything was perfect for our stay;  the delicious food served, the spotless garden area and the cleanliness of the whole villa.

The villa's staff were outstanding; their attention to detail and genuine care ensured our stay was comfortable and memorable. The facilities at the villa were first-class—everything was clean and well-maintained, from the spacious interiors of the rooms, huge bathrooms, to the expansive balcony offering plenty of privacy. The ambiance was perfect for relaxation and unwinding.

One of the highlights was the food prepared on-site; it was simply first-class, rivaling top restaurants in flavor and presentation. Having the ability to walk straight out to the ocean and enjoy a clean, serene beach was the cherry on top of our relaxing stay.

While the villa isn't close to major shopping areas, it didn't detract from our experience as the tranquility and beauty of the location were exactly what we needed after days of travel and sightseeing. Villa Saffron is the perfect place to recharge, making it an ideal retreat for adults looking for a peaceful getaway.

From manager Sunhil who believes that the customer is God to Kasoon whose smile lights up a room to Malindu who cares for the pool and every sunbathing need to Chuminda the Chef who conjures up fantastic meals from daily breakfasts to incredible Crab Curry by the sea. Everyone goes above and beyond including Milinda the owner who popped by during our stay and arranged medical care for one of our party by calling in help from his friends. Villa Saffron is a piece of paradise on Hikkaduwa beach and we will definitely be back. Thank you Sunhil and your wonderful team for looking after us so well.
