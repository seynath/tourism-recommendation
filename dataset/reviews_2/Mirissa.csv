We stayed in the Clove Cottage which was rustic but beautiful. It was very private with a balcony that looked out over the jungle. The gardens were beautiful with lots of different colours of the native plants. There were lots of monkeys, squirrels, peacocks and beautiful birds to keep us entertained. The staff were fantastic. They would always stop and speak to you to ask how you were going, what you were doing that day and if there was anything they could do for us. They were the absolute best. The breakfast was different everyday with a mixture of Western and traditional. They did the best scrambled eggs I have ever eaten. The pool was nice and warm so easy to get into and overlooked the beautiful gardens. 
The beach is just across the road and town is a 5 minute walk or a quick Tuk Tuk ride. There are plenty of places close by to eat or drink.
My only negative is the roof over the balcony keeps the breeze out and makes it a bit hotter but I understand the roof would be perfect if it was raining so it's not really a negative.
I would recommend this place in a heart beat and would like to thank all the staff for making our stay here so enjoyable.

When we arrived to check in the receptionist asked if we had received her message on booking.com. We had not received it, and on checking the messages at 11:30am the morning of check-in she had tried to send us a message informing us they could not give us our confirmed room we had reserved. The reason? They had given it to someone else the day before. So they had no room to give us for our reservation. They expected us to just be ok with this, we were not as we now had no where to stay. After some conversation they tried to find us alternative accommodation. The first place they took us to was a right next door but the rooms were not nice. Another one only had availability for one night (we needed 2), and another one was not near the beach (the reason we had RESERVED this hotel). After about half an hour of getting nowhere they finally offered us a room with a more expensive nightly rates for our original room rate but they only had it available for one night. This was a nice concession and we took it as the kids were getting restless and we just wanted to put our bags somewhere. Once in the room we managed on our own to find another place to book for our second night.

The only person who I will say was amazing was Lesenke (sp?) who went out of his way showing my husband to the other hotel options, setting up the room they finally gave us, getting us an extra mattress, and providing us with the wifi.

Unfortunately the whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths and ruined our first day in Mirissa. The hotel itself is in a great location, the beach is beautiful, breakfast was delicious, and the room we were in was spacious, bright, and comfortable (although a lot of ants). It’s just too bad they don’t honour their reservations.

The location is absolutely 5 stars, it has great views and it is at the quieter end of the beach which we appreciated. The staff are also very pleasant and friendly and we had nice breakfasts looking at the sea each morning. 

The property however, is full of damp, infested with ants, mosquitoes and cockroaches.  To call this a boutique spa which I have seen on other platforms is completely misleading and is quite upsetting to feel you are being so mislead after travelling from very far and spending so much money. 

Our room was on the 1st floor, it was unclean and is in desperate need of investment and renovation.  I wonder if the positive reviews are based on the other building, as they are worlds away from the building we were in.

Whilst we were there our neighbours also shared the same experience and we saw staff taking bug killer and disinfectants to various rooms.

So for a bit more accurate information for people to manage your expectations are below.

Let’s start with the good

The location is great

Breakfast with a lovely view

Lovely staff especially Sochi the manager

The bad

The rooms are infested with insects ants, mosquitos and cockroaches

There is damp and mold everywhere

The air con units are so loud it’s hard to relax on the balcony

Palm villa is very expensive for what is provided .

The whole place needs renovating and is dirty

The owner / agent Maria is very rude and arrogant. 

We didn't complain when we arrived but asked her to look at the air con unit next door as it was horribly loud. 

Aggressively she came round banging on our door and was very rude. We didn't want to speak to her again so just put up with it.

I would suggest she should learn some customer service skills as it wasn't very nice",Bug Infested room / arrogant and rude agent!!!,2024-02,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d1902973-r941773171-Palm_Villa_Mirissa-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html

Our expectations were high after going through social media and seeing the photos. On arrival, no one welcomed us. Our driver had to carry our luggage to the lobby area. Got a free room with sea view. #97  just above the gym. The room was specious but had broken luggage rack and issues with water pressure. We didn't mind it. After using the gym,  tried to take a shower but no hot water. informed the front office and the young gentleman told he will inform the maintenance. Half an hour later, since nothing happened went to reception to check. The same gentleman told they can't do anything. So I requested a room change. The receptionist told they are full and don't have any rooms available for a room change. Since we booked the room via Agoda, checked the Agoda website and to my surprise there were enough rooms to book. So I booked a room for euro 88 for one night and showed the receptionist  to give a room since I have made an extra booking. Then, a few of the management staff got involved and offered a room change. Saying they are not full and have enough rooms to move. The next day, the general manager requested us to come to his office to talk about the situation. Wonder why he didn't come to us instead.  Felt like going to the principals office all over again. After talking to GM, Mr. Liyanage  assured that a refund would be authorised to Agoda. As promised he authorised a refund for one night but the authorization was not for the euro 88 booking which I did for the night but the first night out of the tree nights block booking which was euro 65.
We feel like we were ripped off  for a hotel, which is not up to standards. Bed sheets were patched, bathroom fittings were loose, and television fittings were hanging. Staff not trained or not interested but i must say, except few hard working staff members. Kishan from the restaurant who is a hardworking person and Anupama the executive house keeper. Who had just started but tried to do everything to make our stay a good one. According to GM one of our booking came to another ota, so they couldn't refund the room night, which was booked for euro 88 but the cheaper night.

Room was spacious and clean with a wonderful view of the beach. Each room has its own private balcony or veranda where you can sit and enjoy the view of the ocean with hardly any disturbances.
Service was excellent. From the point I called Mr Liyanage for the booking till I checked out, each and every person went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. The gentleman at the restaurant named Arthur ( I think thats his name) always had our favorite spot reserved and prepared for us without us even requesting for it. The pool attendant also was exceptionally helpful.
Location is really nice with the ocean in the front and the Polwatta river on the side. Also during our stay we managed to visit Mathara fort, Secret Beach, Coconut Tree Hill & Hakgedi Ella waterfall all within half an hours drive from the hotel.
Overall our stay was extremely pleasant and if I am to point one are they can look to improve, that would be to change the menu from one day to another.

Not worth it for the price payed. This hotel should be rated 0 zero NOT 4.3.
We have visited many countries never seen a rude receptionist (both) like in this hotel. Very bad customer service. 
I am now reading some of the previous reviews where other customers have experienced the same. I hope after reading this review hotel management take proper action and train their staffs. 
We will NEVER come back to this place again. 
Before booking we saw the rating 4.3 and believed this will be great hotel. ALL FAKE. I cant believe someone rated 5 this hotel I would rate 0. 
Starting from the hallway its either broken or not cleaned. Washroom shower with mold and smell. Shower handle does not work properly. 
Shower sliding door need two people to hold and close. Balcony railings are broken, didn't let my children out for safety. 
For the wifi you need to call everytime as the password keeps on changing. Through out our stay in this hotel all I did was keep calling the reception for washroom tissue, 
water bottle, wifi  password, etc. We wasted our two days in this hotel. Most of the time NO response or they will say ""Will call you back"" and never did. 
One point we complained re their service and this is the exact response of the receptionist ""We are like this you can find another place if you don't like here"". 
After this some staffs are staring at us, we didn't feel safe in this hotel. 
PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE and DONT FEEL SAFE HERE. This is not the experience we want from SriLanka. DO NOT BOOK this hotel. First their service is really bad. 
Never seen a receptionist very rude and attitude and talking to their guest so bad-mannered
We booked halfboard and their dinner menu has only one item nothing else, and that's a pasta with Chicken. I am coming from aboard where I eat that every day 
I don't need to spend money to come Srilanka to eat pasta.
When we requested for Srilankan food they said we have to pay additional. We spoke to the receptionist and said that we didn't have any issue with other places we stayed why your dinner menu is not good. Her response was ""this is what we provide for our set menu"".
This is our 7th hotel in Srilanka and we didnt experience anything like this in any of the other 6 hotels. 
If you walk 5 min from the hotel you can get good food for reasonable price. Why I have to pay for the halfboard and additional again. Worse experience.

 Our room was a good size and had a great view of the pool and beach but the woodwork on the balcony was rotting and dangerous.

5 minute drive to Mirissa fisheries harbor from here, where all whale and dolphin watching tours starts.

We observed some damages in furniture and think it would be better to have square plug sockets in all power outlets as almost all new electronics comes with square plug tops for charging. Clean service could be a little improved. 

The main problem here is the parking. There's no separate parking space. Taking vehicles in and out is hard when there are many guests and when their vehicles are parked right outside and in front of the reception lobby and swimming pool.
