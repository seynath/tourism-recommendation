We stayed in a spacious sea view cabana that was perfectly equipped for all weather conditions, whether rain (umbrellas) or shine (bug spray). The cabana offered a great balance of luxury and comfort, with more than enough space to relax and enjoy the serene surroundings.

The service was impeccable throughout our stay. Special mention to Dinesh, who went above and beyond to organize a beautiful birthday meal right on the beach—an experience we’ll never forget. Our butler, Dulanjana, was outstanding. He was professional, attentive, and made sure we had no worries during our stay. His care and attention to detail truly enhanced our experience.

The food at Jetwing Surf was incredible. Every meal was a visual and culinary delight, thanks to the talented chef. The quality and presentation were always of the highest standard. Even during our early morning safari, the hotel ensured that we had a packed breakfast and drinks ready for our 5 AM departure, which was a thoughtful touch.

Our safari at Kumana National Park was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of our trip. This was all recommended and arranged by the resort.  We were lucky enough to see leopards, elephants, deer, and so many other animals up close in their natural habitat. The wildlife was abundant, and the best part was how peaceful it felt—at times, it seemed like we had the entire park to ourselves!

The experience was well-organized and truly immersive. The beauty of Kumana lies not just in the animals but also in the quiet, untouched wilderness. It’s a must-do for anyone visiting the area, and we highly recommend it!

We also indulged in in-room massages, which were fantastic—perfect for unwinding. The pool was clean and a great spot to relax during the day.

This resort truly goes above and beyond, treating guests like royalty. We are already recommending it to our friends and family and cannot wait to return ourselves. A huge thank you to the team for making our stay so memorable!",Amazing experience!,2024-10,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d12949765-r976780368-Jetwing_Surf-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html

The journey through and stay in SL were superb , and the Jetwing Surf and Kottukal Beach house ,Pottuvil, were special. This marriage celebration hoisting was also, it seems, was maiden for the Jetwing Pottuvil. The rooms, Breakfast-Lunch-Dinner services, Venue preparation, Haldi ceremoney, Sangeet ceremony, Marriage ceremony, Dance and cultural  functions , marriage dinners on sea beach,  arranging Marriage Registration at the venue etc were all meticulously planned and executed to perfection.
Our hearts were filled with with joy and happiness by seeing all the arrangement at the venue, the sea beach, the scenic beauty of the resort and the spacious rooms  and the decorated swimming pool sites to suit the occasions.
The food services served at the occasions were very good.
The sea beaches, lawns, swimming pools etc, especially at Kottukal Beach House, were so beautiful that one has to get lost into one's romantic days. 
Above all , the Management and staff of the both the resorts deserve all praise for their services, behaviour, courtesy and ever willingness on their parts to be of any kind of help at any time were praiseworthy. 
We wish  to return to this venue again on any other occasion  with friends and family. 
Certian suggestions : 
1. The road from Jetwing Surf to Kottukal Beach house , about 100 mtrs stretch length, is not metalled - it is broken . Walking is difficult on the road. Better it is repaired and maintained by both the resorts.
2. There is paucity of light on the road from Jetwing Surf to Kottukal Beach House.  Both the resorts can look into this aspect and arrange proper lights.
3. Jetwing surf can maintain a e-rickshaw ( tuktuk) service within their resort and also between the two resorts so that commuting between the two places is not troblesome.

Jetwing Surf Pottuvil, Sri Lanka - a place for R & R.
Review of Jetwing Surf
Reviewed 13 Nov 2022

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * *

I would like to start by referring to my earlier review posted to Trip Advisor dated 13th November 2022 re the visit to Jetwing Surf, Pottuvil Point, Sri Lanka.

This second visit was on Sunday 4th February 2024 when eleven of us booked into 6 Cabanas in great trepidation as the others had at the last minute read my 13th November 2022 review.  Some of the servers recognized us & assured us that we will be happy this time & we were.

All Cabanas had glass panels placed right up to the architecturally beautiful Conic Rooves, blocking out any insects & creepy crawlies which made our previous stay miserable.   They only had fans inside the Cabanas then.  Now they have installed air conditioners too.  

It would have cost them quite a bit.  However, I hope guests will read this review of mine & visit the place hopefully not just for a day or two.  Why not make it a beautiful vacation during the season and I assure you, no one will regret it.

The No. 12 Cabana my husband & I occupied had an extremely comfortable King-size bed with pillows so perfect, only the alarm would wake us from sleep.  All other amenities from a mini bar, coffee/tea service to hair dryer, little toiletries, bathrobes, beach slippers, umbrellas etc. etc. were there for our use.  The shower toilet area is unique with a style of its own.

Though there is no Television set in the Resort, we had free Wi-Fi service.

There was a hiccup in our No.12 Cabana which was not the case with the ones occupied by our friends.  The Toilet had a suction issue which the management tried hard to correct not quite successfully & in fact, offered a change of Cabana too which we did not take up.  

The service all round was excellent.  Led by Pavan (butler/server/other roles), the staff worked at tandem & the Chef de cuisine made sure we had the desired à la carte meals presented in decorative style.  On this occasion, all meals were flavoursome & the quantity just right.   Way to go Chef Gemunu Chameera & Team!

The Swimming pool & the surrounding area in the resort is beautiful.  Once more, I hope the management will make the (romantic) lighting on the ground better as we had to use our cellphone lights to walk the area leading to the dining hall. 

Our trip this time was not during the season.  One should go to the East Coast during the dry season which is from May to September when the beaches are pristine, the sea of Sri Lanka is calmer & water sports are possible.

As a final note, my husband & I were absolutely thrilled with the Management as they had in a matter of 15 months, attended to my & maybe other guests’ previous comments about shortfalls.   

Kudos & blessings to the Jetwing Surf Resident Manager Mr. Azeem Hafi, & his dedicated, pleasant Team.

We took a long taxi to get here fome colombo! Took us 8 hours. Arranged by the resort which was very helpful and efficient. 

The cabanas - we took a risk with no air con as the fans and sea breeze we thought would be sufficient, unfortunately it was sweltering hot.  We had a lower cabana which doesn't have ceiling fans but has the standing fans...it was so so hot that sleep was difficult.. this heat is nothing the resort can do about of course and I understand and agree with the owner that air con isn't good for the planet ..so I totally get it. But its important to note how hot we felt in case this will be an issue for you..it was for us and did affect our enjoyment.  I ended up with a heat rash half way through the holiday!:( 

This said Anna was SO accommodating and moved us to an upper cabana when they were free, she did this without charge and we definitely felt cooler in an upper cabana as they have ceiling fans and higher ceilings.. so I'd recommend if going when hot to book an upper cabana..plus the view is nicer and feels more private. 

They also gave us an extra fan to help. 

The cabanas are comfy though, beds were nice comfy pillows, kept very clean and a nice bathroom:)

The beach is completely deserted, so our walks were usually just us..in paradise.  Important to add..the waves in the sea, it is a surf point of course, are powerful so you can't swim or float..you can jump about in the waves which is fun just is quite tiring ha ha as you can't relax as such. ;) 

It's great breakfast is included and it's tasty..the menu is mainly Italian and its OK, some of the dishes are a little strange in flavour and personally I didn't think all worked and we really really would have loved more local food.  We had sri lankan curry one night and it was fantastic! But then the chef didn't want to cook it again:( I think this is a real shame..as its lots of pizza and pasta.  The pizzas are amazing though ..the best pizza I've ever tasted.  But we were dissapointed we only got sri lankan food once at thw resort.  But I guess for those travelling around Sri Lanka it's a lovely great If they've only been eating sri lankan.

The staff are incredible here...Harry and the other man who worked in the evening with him plus the man who cleaned the rooms..everyone was so kind, so polite, such helpful joyful people and we absolutely loved their company and help.  They work really hard and can't do enough for you. 

Harry you're wonderful! 

Nicola the owner is great, really interesting to talk to, helpful and a real passion for the paradise he's created.  Anna is also very very helpful and kind..and runs lovely yoga classes.  I'd add that I wish we'd been told about the mediation schedule when we arrived as we would have joined every morning but didn't get shown it until 3 days before we left.  More mediation would be wonderful.:)

Overall this place is paradise..I loved it..but the lack of air con was a real challenge for us BUT we did know there was none so  there's no fault of the resort..just wanted to forewarn others if going when it's hot. 

Definitely go if you're visiting sri lanka !! It's like a retreat..just go, get under the coconut palms, listen to the waves and birds.

Currently the location is the only thing that delivers. This hotel is poor. Seriously it needs an overhaul of everything. This might be ok if you are twenty but I came with my family and my husband and I were gutted. Honestly hostels were better nearby offering shady swimming pools and comfortable loungers. (Wave bay) and Surf and Sun utterly beautiful - we escaped there during the days because hotel so disappointing.
So… breakfast is pretty inedible, maybe the omelette is ok because it’s cooked from scratch. Flies in fruit. Coffee is powdered sachets and you are charged additional for a Nescafé machine coffee but the machine broke after one coffee. The lifts are filthy. The air con in our room was broken and didn’t work we had to have it fixed. In three days no one cleaned my room until I asked in the evening. We were out by 9.30am each day … and when they cleaned no surfaces were cleaned just sink washed and floor swept. You can’t have pool towels for the beach so if you are travelling with a family you have to buy four towels!

The Pool, again it’s got potential but it’s missing basic necessities- old hard/uncomfortable sun loungers with black plastic cushions (bird poo featuring), no shade available, not one umbrella for any loungers or tables on offer outside(I asked, there were none available), I mean surely this is basic? It would take so little investment to upgrade. No service at the pool. I think because it’s low grade hotel the staff (who seem to hide in a back office) don’t seem motivated to look after you. 

Sorry unless there’s a new management, or entrepreneur with vision I’d avoid if you are a family…

Price point way too expensive for what it offers.",Location is the only thing that delivers.,2024-07,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3348959-d9587644-r960057993-The_Blue_Wave_Hotel-Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html

The bathroom was functional but dated. We had ants crawling all over the bedside table and this hotel was the only place I got bitten while I slept despite the mosquito net. The pool area is nice but having to dodge the bird poo while sat on the sun lounger or in the pool was not enjoyable and something we haven't experienced anywhere else ever. 

The lunch menu was basic, took a long time to be made and was very small. We went for the chicken and chips as we were in a rush before a safari and it was Happy Meal size. Luckily we didn't bother with the breakfast included option and just paid for breakfast one morning which was really poor. There were much better options just outside of the hotel that are much much cheaper. 

Each evening when we came back from dinner out there was a frog in our room and all over the front door which was very annoying. 

We also found the hotel staff the most unfriendly and unhelpful compared with everywhere else we stayed. Be aware the hotel is all sand and the staff don't help with bags.

Not necessarily a problem but we were in room 1 and were woken up by the call to prayers at 5am ish as it was just so loud and took us by surprise. 

Overall we were really disappointed with this hotel. Should have stayed at the hostel we originally booked which was less than half the price!",Very average and massively overpriced!,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3348959-d8439700-r971163067-The_Spice_Trail-Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html

We were not disappointed with our choice. The property is a nicely converted colonial era villa with a fantastic aspect and view of the coastline. From our 1st floor room with a balcony we were afforded a fantastic view of the sea and to hear the waves crashing onto the beach.  Our room was generously sized with a high ceiling and with a comfortable king bed and associated mosquito net.  It had a decent bathroom with twin basins and a rain shower. Plenty of hot water. Room air conditioning worked very well and added to ceiling fans for those who prefer, which are quieter and allow you to hear the sounds of the sea.

The property is small with only a few rooms, which assists the feeling of serenity but although small scale it is assigned with a couple of permanent staff members to service guest needs. A minor flaw was that there was no “official” way to make contact with them and there were no phones in the room or a bell to draw attention. One morning wanting a coffee (no kettles in the rooms) and after knocking on a few doors, I was forced to finally give up.  However, an hour later I was successful and finally had a delicious plunger coffee delivered to the room and foresightedly then preordered for the following morning. An a la carte dinner was also pre ordered and highly delicious curries were prepared by the inhouse chef.  We purchased a bottle of wine in town as none was available at the property, but they did stock beer. Breakfasts were also very good.

Other points to highlight include the generous gardens bordering the sea, the friendly in-house dogs and a decent pool. 

Would recommend if looking for a quiet and beautiful stay close by Arugam Bay (tuk-tuks easily arranged).",Serene seaside property close to Arugam Bay,2024-05,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d4799724-r954370906-Kottukal_Beach_House_By_Jetwing-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html
