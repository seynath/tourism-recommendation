Although we don’t expect five-star standards, our past events at Jie Jie by Jetwing since 2018 had been handled excellently. However, with the recent management change, the service quality and overall experience seem to have noticeably declined.

Firstly, while Mr. Eric and Champika made commendable efforts, certain issues impacted our event.

The handling of the event’s end time by Mr. Wasantha felt unprofessional—though we had agreed on a midnight end, he began pressuring us to stop the band as early as 11:15 p.m. This created unnecessary stress and disruption.

Additionally, despite providing 10 kg of dry bites, 15 kg of guava, and 160 green apples, only a few plates were served in the Grand Ballroom, making us question if our items were served as agreed. Furthermore, staff often cleared plates and glasses without checking if they were still in use, disrupting our guests’ experience.

The driver meal was substandard, not in line with what we'd expect from a star-class hotel. Some staff members even spoke rudely to our team, including senior managers, and the overall attitude felt rushed, as if the staff were eager for the event to end. Due to the rain, we wanted to use the indoor entrance to the ballroom, but staff discouraged this, causing inconvenience.

We were also charged unexpectedly an additional Rs. 25,000 for electricity, which we had assumed was included in our package.

An extra 24 bottles of soft drinks were billed without our authorization, which led to unapproved additional costs.

There was a significant water leak in the ballroom due to heavy rain, We intended to block one door of the Grand Ball Room, but the lock was broken, the key card for one of our rooms failed, and our team had to wait nearly an hour for access. The maintenance team eventually opened the door manually, attributing the issue to a dead lock battery and an unpleasant odor in the hall, all of which affected the ambiance of our event.

Overall, despite some staff efforts, our experience didn’t meet expectations.",Disappointing Experience at Jie Jie by Jetwing,2024-10,BUSINESS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1097569-d10422418-r977107692-Jie_Jie_Beach_by_Jetwing-Panadura_Western_Province.html

The staff were friendly and helpful, as it is in most of Jetwing’s locations. The spa was absolutely amazing! They will guide you through to choose the exact treatment you need. The only thing is sometimes there will be only male staff at the spa. If this is a concern, check with them in advance.
Getting to the food - the buffets were amazing. The pastries were exceptional and there were always decent options for vegetarians.

We informed the front desk, and yes, they changed our room to the next door, but the AC was still the same; we just ignored it for the time being and ordered food from the hotel restaurant, which was a Chicken Fried Rice Rs.1800 with cardboard papadam and dry rice; we also ordered a boneless chicken, but the restaurant call operator asked what we meant by boneless. Wtf, the hotel restaurant doesn't know what boneless is, so we said, ""Yako, it's Katu nathi chicken,"" and he was like, ""Ahh, okay, okay.""

Still we bared everything and didn't even complain about those but when we check-out and waiting for the bill to be processed all of a sudden a hotel staff comes and says that a 'Body Lotion' is missing from the room, I was like okay so what? the person said that like I have a stolen a TV or a iron from the room, the person humiliated me Infront of my friends and other people, I have stayed in countless hotels all over Sri Lanka and I have used all the equipment's and products the hotel provides which is complimentary and which can be taken home but this hotel doesn't even let a customer who paid around 60-70k per night to take a ' Small Body Lotion' which I used during the stay, I was really annoyed and dissatisfied with the overall service the hotel gave us, idk what has happened to the Jetwing Hotel Chain.

Even the final bill was messed up; I paid the room bill when I checked in, and the final bill was only the bar and restaurant bill, but the person charged me again for the rooms and gave me a receipt for my card; again, they reimbursed the amount to my card, and I waited for more than 15 minutes, which made me think I would never come to Jetwing again or recommend anyone, not even an enemy; I hope Jetwing management looks into this.",Worst customer service in a Beautiful place.,2024-07,FRIENDS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1097569-d10422418-r958537569-Jie_Jie_Beach_by_Jetwing-Panadura_Western_Province.html

Absolutely everything was first class - from the managers, the customer service at reception, the porters, to the catering and housekeeping staff, everyone went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. No job was too big for anyone. The warm bright smiles and attentive nature of all staff made us feel at home. In particular, the managers, Dumindu and Kushani were exceptional in their leadership. The  reception staff, Shakila, Chamika, and Dilshan were always on hand for anything we needed. 

The spacious rooms, with a private garden leading to the swimming pool was a dream. Clean rooms, lovely bathroom amenities, smart TV all added to the experience. The beds were so comfortable, that we slept in most mornings! Yet the staff at breakfast still accommodated past the breakfast time. The garden/pool views from the room were so relaxing, I felt like I was in tropic heaven! 

The food was mouth watering and delicious. Something I looked forward to every morning and evening. The variety of choice with the fruits and salads, the mains and desserts, everything was cooked to perfection. I have a dairy allergy, so the staff would let me know what dessert options were suitable for me.

While we wouldn't classify this as a 5-star hotel by international standards, we were very satisfied with our stay.

The hotel boasts stunning architecture, featuring large open spaces that beautifully blend the indoors with the outdoors. Although the hotel shows signs of age and could benefit from some modernization, the overall ambiance and setting were incredible.

Dining:
The hotel offers both à la carte and buffet dining options. The buffet consistently featured a mix of ""Western"" cuisine, Indian dishes, and local Sri Lankan specialties. The variety and quality of the food were excellent, with flavors that truly delighted our taste buds. The selection of beverages was also more than satisfactory.

Service:
The hotel staff were consistently friendly, smiling, and helpful throughout our stay.

Facilities:
The outdoor areas, including the beach, were clean and well-maintained. The pool was large and kept in excellent condition. There were always enough sunbeds available, and the attentive staff were quick to prepare them for us as soon as we approached.

A special thank you goes to Aruna and his team at the Pool Bar. His warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay—Aruna, a big thank you!

A Few Tips for Improvement:

- The hotel would benefit from a planned and gradual modernization process.
- The preparation time for meals and drinks in the à la carte restaurant was relatively long, even though the hotel was not busy during our stay (off-season). It might be worth considering better kitchen management. However, the wait was ultimately worth it as the food was delicious.",Wonderful Stay with a Few Areas for Improvement,2024-08,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d586453-r967677794-The_Blue_Water-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html

We have stayed here on many occasions and am delighted to say that standards in all areas were excellent. The GM Mr Gihan and his team work very hard to ensure all guests needs are met or exceeded and we have very good reason to say that ours were certainly far exceeded. When we arrived at Colombo airport we did so minus our luggage, and with no help form the airline to locate it or indeed to offer any emergency help. We got to the hotel frustrated and tired and were met by the the amazing serenity of the place, and from there Ms Kushani stepped in and took over. Without this amazing lady we would never have redeemed our luggage nor indeed been able to have our wedding at the sister location Glenross Living. Ms Kushani went went way beyond expectation and we will be forever thankful to her.

We found the whole team at the hotel to be extremely helpful in every respect, other people to mention are Duminda as part of the front of house staff who was always on hand to answer any queries or to ensure any issues were dealt with quickly, our housekeeper Sujit ensured our room was always immaculate and he always did it with a great big smile.

The food quality at the Blue Water is incredible, we mostly ate in the buffet restaurant and the choice of dishes ranging from western to Sri Lankan was amazing. Felis one of the restaurant managers was always on hand to make sure that you enjoyed everything.

The hotel gardens and pool area were looking really great and it is a joy to be there. We had a great stay and look forward to seeing everyone on our return.",Such a lovely place to be,2024-04,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d586453-r949993897-The_Blue_Water-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html

Good things:
Waiting staff very friendly.
Large room with balcony , a/c and ceiling fan. 
Swimming pool ,warm and peaceful. Over 30 sun-loungers
Did a great job of washing and ironing clothes at a reasonable price.
Food was a buffet when there were more guests and set menu when there were less.
Beautifully maintained gardens. 
Husband enjoyed his back massage. 

Not so good:
Had to be moved due to train noise ( nearest reception), Wi-Fi not working and fridge not being cold ( even in the new room the fridge was never cold enough). Wi-Fi dipped up several times over the days
This was the only place where I was bitten by mosquitoes even while wearing repellent.
Gym machines not working
No information at front desk re local activities 
Very isolated

Worse thing for us was that we would have had a 12 hour wait after check out until we were collected to go to the airport seating In reception that had no a/c or even fans. HOT moved us to Columbo so we had an air con room in another hotel in which to wait. Great service from them . 

Sea was too rough to swim in September, which we didn’t know. Would have preferred to have stayed at some of the other hotels for more nights, where there was more to do and see.",Two nights here would have been enough,2024-09,COUPLES,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d13493984-r970595210-The_Villas_Wadduwa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html

Ms Ishani at the front desk, Rukman as our room cleaner and the head chef along with the Sous Chef and everyone else made our 4 night stay extremely comfortable. (26th Dec - 30th Dec 2023) 

Right from the start with the Tamarind juice as a welcome drink to the final bill, everything was extremely personal. 

We were travelling with an 18 month old baby and special care was taken to provide us with milk and baby food at our request. 

The resort had a warmth to it only due to the staff. 

The buffets for breakfast and dinners (we took half boarding) were just perfect. Despite all of us guests being from different parts of the world they catered to almost everyone's taste.

Upstairs a four-poster bed, with a view of the ocean, and the biggest bathroom we have ever seen with jacuzzi bath, his and hers washbasins, huge shower and a dressing room. The rooms look onto a lush garden, with our own private sun loungers, and then the beach and the sea. The beach is west facing and we enjoyed a couple of spectacular sunsets. It really is beautiful, and we didn't want to go anywhere else. There's also a lovely swimming pool with an unusual 'jacuzzi' with bubbling sunbeds. On our final night we were treated to a barbeque on the beach with more fish than we could eat - a fabulous way to end our holiday.

Let me share with you a few notes to give you a clear understanding about the hotel its self, the team, food and ocean)
 
The hotel is not too big, very comfortable, with a few types of rooms: from standard to presidential suit. All prices are really fine, so you can choose the best for you. The Very nice thing is that all rooms have their own ocean view! And it is amazing to see sunrise or sunset from your room.
The hotel team is very attentive and always ready to support and help. Key-persons speak very-well English, so no probs with any demands. I’d like to say that Mr Susantha – general manager is always in the hotel, controlling all processes. Mr Gishantha Withana – senior manager of the restaurant with his team is very smiley and open to show you Sri Lankan traditional food: during the lunch you will have a possibility to try seafood, chicken, fish or beef curry, very tasty and always fresh fruits and juices. Don’t forget to ask for the real Sri Lankan tea as a cocktail!) It’s really very cool and nice.    
 
One more thing I’d like to share – the OAK RAY ayurvedic center. It is located inside the hotel. Annushka – one of the best master I ever met before. First of all – he is multi-time certified professional with medical background who does different types of massage himself, Secondly – he is very nice, open, supportive and caring person. I strongly recommend to take a program during your stay in the hotel. The price is more then affordable.

We had our own private pool with tiles falling apart around the edges and the pool itself had not been filtered and was full of flies and debris.
Our bed was broken and held up by a board and the edges around the bed were also broken. 
We had paid for all inclusive but unfortunately the buffet lacked variety and seemed to cater to the European clientele only which is surprising as we were expecting to eat traditional Sri Lankan food. We were told on Valentine's Day that there will be a good selection of food but unfortunately it was one of the worst buffets we had as there was only bland salads and spaghetti again disappointing.

Our recent visit to Taprobana by Asia Leisure left us with mixed feelings. We booked two rooms for a family gathering, including a birthday celebration for our kids and accommodation for our mother-in-law. While there were some positives, overall, the experience fell short of our expectations.

Firstly, the food at Taprobana was a highlight. We enjoyed well-prepared dishes that satisfied our taste buds, albeit the spread could have been more extensive to cater adequately for everyone.

On the downside, the location seemed somewhat neglected. Maintenance issues were noticeable, which detracted from the overall ambiance. Additionally, our rooms were not as clean as we had hoped, which was disappointing given the reputation of the establishment.

The weather didn't cooperate either, as it was a rainy day during our stay. This limited our outdoor activities and impacted our ability to fully enjoy the surroundings.

One positive aspect was the pool, which provided a refreshing escape despite the weather. It was well-maintained and offered a pleasant experience for both children and adults.

In summary, while Taprobana by Asia Leisure has its merits, such as good food and a decent pool, the overall experience was marred by issues with cleanliness, maintenance, and the weather conditions. For a special occasion like a birthday celebration, we expected a higher level of satisfaction.",Mixed Feelings at Taprobana by Asia Leisure,2023-07,FAMILY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d7358937-r956699665-Taprobana_Wadduwa_By_Asia_Leisure-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html
